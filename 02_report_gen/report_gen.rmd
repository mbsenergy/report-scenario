# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2025-2050 (with projections up to
2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of
proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural
models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of
regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our
elaborations.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and
economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and
fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the
pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of
the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables
in line with the historical average trend.

In this perspective, we defined three scenarios:

-   The **Low RES scenario** is characterized by permanently high fuels
    and power prices amid negative or zero economic growth depressing
    investments and weighing on the energy transition process.\

-   In the **Reference scenario**, is characterized by the energy
    transition process progress leading to a diversification of energy
    sources supported by the existing policies. This, combined with
    efficiency maintains the energy market on a transformation path. The
    economic growth slowly recovers over the next two years.

-   The **High RES scenario** would materialize in the event of
    favorable weather conditions and a fast energy transition, supported
    by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing power and
    fossil fuels demand over the next few years. This would limit energy
    prices upside potential and then fuel a downward acceleration.

## The Outlook for Italy's Energy Market Amid Regulatory Changes, Geopolitical Tensions, and RES Dynamics

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

-   Market signals remain positive for RES-E, with **captured prices
    projected to stay above the LCOE** through 2040. Despite that,
    regulatory delays and grid infrastructure challenges, if not solved,
    are expected to slow down the expansion of RES-E and BESS, which was
    brilliant in 2023 and 2024, (+ 4.5 GW/year). In the BAU Scenario,
    **RES-E is expected to surpass 50% of the energy mix by 2032**,
    falling short of policy targets.

-   We forecast a **bullish trend in the electricity price for
    2025-2026**: CCGTs cost reductions due to gas price trends are in
    fact compensated by sustained logistic costs and the CO2 price
    increasing trend

-   For CCGTs, flexibility is a key driver to business success:
    **captured CSS is projected to avergare 10 €/MWh** for the next
    years, while baseload CSS remains negative (-2.5 €/MWh on average),
    with **declining load factors** (1500 EOH, on average in the
    Northern zone). The increased penetration of RES will lead to a more
    significant reduction in EOH in the Southern zone, accompanied by
    higher captured prices. Strategic market reforms, like capacity
    remuneration mechanisms, are crucial to mitigate missing money risks
    as ASM volumes narrow.

-   A modest economic recovery and increased electrification are
    **boosting electricity consumption to 312 TWh in 2024**, but
    **demand is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until
    2026**. Thanks to NRRP measures, forecasts are ranging from 327 TWh
    to 358 TWh by 2030. Meanwhile, a contraction in overall electricity
    demand in Europe,coupled with improved hydro generation and nuclear
    availability, contributed to a 15% increase in net imports in 2023,
    reaching 53 TWh. Systematic overgeneration from high RES-E
    production and slow demand recovery is likely to keep imports above
    45 TWh through 2040.

-   Gas prices have risen slightly this summer due to geopolitical
    tensions but are not expected to rise significantly until winter,
    with a **potential bullish cycle anticipated by winter 2025-2026**.
    **Normalization is expected from 2026 onwards** as liquefaction and
    regasification capacity increases, easing LNG market tensions. The
    **average CO2 price for 2024 is projected to remain close to
    €70/ton**. Additional demand from the maritime sector, combined with
    the phasing out of free allowances for the aviation sector and the
    implementation of the CBAM, is expected to support a rise in CO2
    prices towards the €110/ton threshold by 2030.

### Key Insights {.unnumbered}

#### Modest 2024 growth highlights slow recovery towards pre-crisis levels by 2027

*Italian power demand rose by 2.3% in 2024*, reaching 312.2 TWh, closely
aligning with our IIIQ24 projections (a variance of just 9 GWh). This
marks the *first annual increase since 2018*, excluding the 2021
post-pandemic rebound. However, *growth remains modest*, reflecting
*macroeconomic challenges, delayed electrification, and weak industrial
performance*. GDP expanded by only 0.8%, and industrial output continued
to contract, particularly in energy-intensive sectors.

The 2024 increase in power demand was partly driven by a *rebound in
industrial consumption, supported by the normalization of gas prices* as
Europe adapts its supply mix to the absence of Russian piped flows.
Expected declines in TTF and PSV prices are easing cost pressures on
industries, reversing the significant consumption drop in 2023 caused by
energy-saving measures during the 2022--2023 gas price surge. However,
*persistent industrial stagnation and modest GDP growth projected at
+0.9% for 2025 have tempered expectations for electricity demand*. This,
combined with *partial decoupling observed between economic growth and
electricity consumption*, has prompted a *downward revision of our power
demand forecast*: -0.4 GW in 2025, -1.7 GW in 2026, and an average
reduction of -4.0 GW annually beyond 2027 in the Reference scenario.
Annual *power demand growth is now projected at 1.1% for 2025--2030*,
equating to 3 TWh per year---a pace not consistently observed since
before 2008. Consumption is expected to exceed pre-crisis levels (320
TWh) by 2027 in the Reference scenario and by 2025 under the High RES
case, supported by favorable economic conditions.

*Over the medium to long term (2030--2050), demand growth is anticipated
to remain steady*, consistently exceeding 2.5 TWh per year. The
*recovery in demand* in this horizon is expected to be *driven by the
electrification of final consumption and the development of new
electricity use segments*, which will play an increasingly critical role
in shaping future demand dynamics, *rather than a full recovery of
industrial production*.

#### PV installations spur RES production but targets attainment is at risk without regulatory progress

2024 marked a *record year for renewable energy production* in Italy,
with 101 TWh generated (+16% from 87 TWh in 2023), bringing the *RES
share of total production to 49.8%* (based on data through November).
This growth was driven by a rebound in hydroelectric generation, which
returned to its historical average at 52 TWh (+30% y/y), and by solar
production, which reached 28 TWh (+14% y/y).

The surge in RES production in 2024 was primarily driven by a *19%
increase in PV output*, while *wind production declined by approximately
7%*. This growth in PV generation can be attributed to both the
expansion of installed capacity and higher producibility linked to
improved irradiation levels. *Photovoltaic capacity increased by 6 GW*,
exceeding the 5 GW added in 2023, while *wind capacity grew by 600 MW*,
consistent with the 500 MW installed the previous year. *Lombardy and
Lazio led the rankings* for newly installed capacity, aligning with
historical trends and both surpassing the "Aree Idonee" target for
installations during 2021--2024.

Our *wind installed capacity projections have been slightly revised*
from the IIIQ24 release, reflecting limited offshore wind development in
the Centre-North region, while adopting a more optimistic outlook for
onshore capacity expansion in the Southern and insular areas. Notably,
the majority of offshore wind projects submitted to MASE in 2023 and
2024 are concentrated in the Southern and insular regions, with only one
project proposed in the Centre-North.

For the medium-to-long term, *we continue to anticipate a deceleration
in RES penetration growth during 2025 and 2026*, particularly in PV
deployment, with installed capacity expected to increase by less than 2
GW in 2025 and just under 3 GW in 2026. This slowdown is attributed to
several factors. Firstly, the scheduling of the *FERX and "FERX
Transitorio" auctions* may encourage some developers to *delay
construction activities* to ensure eligibility for participation. The
FERX Transitorio, designed to ease the transition to the new auctioning
framework, remains in its early implementation phase, with developers
closely monitoring the finalization of operational guidelines. Secondly,
*regulatory uncertainty persists*, driven by delays in *regional
deliberations on the "Aree Idonee" Decree* and the complexities
introduced by the *Testo Unico sulle Rinnovabili (TUFER)*. The TUFER,
published in its final version in the Gazzetta Ufficiale, may pose
additional challenges for developers. For an in-depth analysis of its
implications, refer to our newsletter publication (link).

Consequently, under the Reference scenario, solar installed capacity is
projected to reach only 51 GW and wind capacity 17 GW by 2030,
significantly *below the PNIEC targets of 80 GW and 28 GW*,
respectively. This shortfall is primarily attributed to *the current
permitting pace, which remains insufficient to achieve the 9--10 GW of
annual installations* required to meet national objectives. However,
regulatory advancements and the effective implementation of current
incentive schemes could accelerate RES development, making the 9 GW
annual target a more attainable expectation.

Finally, our demand and RES production projections indicate that *RES
generation will cover 49% of Italian electricity demand by 2030*,
falling significantly short of the PNIEC target of 63%.

#### Italy's storage market is evolving, with 16 GW in projects under evaluation, though regulatory changes could slow deployment

The expected growth of storage in the coming years will be essential in
supporting the integration of non-programmable renewable generation,
ensuring greater stability and flexibility of the national electricity
system. Indeed, storage systems will not only optimise energy management
but also help mitigate the cannibalisation effect of renewable power
plants, improving the overall efficiency of the system.

To support this integration, the *PNIEC defines a target of achieving an
additional capacity of 72 GWh of storage by 2030*, including
utility-scale and distributed projects. *Utility-scale development will
be concentrated mainly in Southern regions*, where the presence of
non-programmable renewable generation is higher, while *distributed
capacity will be developed mainly in Northern Italian regions*, often
integrated with residential and commercial PV systems.

To respond to the goals, the *storage market in Italy is beginning to
evolve* rapidly. An analysis of the authorisation processes submitted to
the MASE reveals a *pipeline of about 16 GW of projects with
authorisations already obtained or under evaluation*. Investments in
storage technology will be mainly supported by *regulated mechanisms*,
including the MACSE auctions, planned for mid-2025 and mainly aimed at
developing capacity in the regions of the South and Islands, and the
Capacity Market, which can help support investments in the areas of the
North, where the MACSE quota will be marginal.

Starting in 2025, *Regions will play a central role in managing
authorizations* for storage power plants. They will be *responsible for
permitting stand-alone storage systems up to 200 MW*, while larger
projects will remain under the jurisdiction of MASE. This shift,
introduced by the final draft of the TUFER, marks a step toward greater
regional autonomy. However, this redistribution of responsibilities *may
result in authorization delays*, potentially preventing some projects
from being ready to participate in the first MACSE auction.

Our IVQ24 projections adopt a refined approach, considering the
*potential for BESS development within incentivizable mechanisms* in the
short and medium term and *RES development trajectories* and
localization in the long term. Total BESS capacity, including both
small- and utility-scale systems, is projected to reach *48 GWh by
2030*, a +41 GWh increase from 2023 levels. Utility-scale capacity is
expected to be concentrated in the Southern and insular regions (78% of
the total), while small-scale storage will dominate in the Northern
regions (60% of the total).

####PUN expected to return to follow a sustained downward trajectory
only post-2026 with new liquefaction capacity

The *annual 2024 PUN average settled at 107.6 €/MWh*, aligning closely
with our IIIQ24 projections (107.8 €/MWh) and slightly exceeding our IQ
and IIQ expectations (Reference case). While this marks a reduction of
approximately 15% compared to the 2023 average of 127 €/MWh, *prices
remain elevated relative to pre-crisis levels*.

Despite high levels of RES production achieved over the past year,
thermoelectric generation remains the marginal source in the Italian
market and is expected to maintain this role in the near term.
Consequently, the slight reduction in power prices is primarily
attributed to developments in the gas market. *In 2024, gas demand
stagnated* due to milder winter temperatures reducing heating needs and
a struggling industrial sector yet to recover fully. This *subdued
demand facilitated the replenishment of gas storage*, creating an
additional buffer against demand fluctuations. Meanwhile, *gas supply
remained stable*, with no significant interruptions, allowing prices to
edge closer to pre-crisis levels.

However, *gas price volatility remained high*, driven by the termination
of Russian gas supply contracts and delays in developing liquefaction
capacity. *We anticipate a tight gas market with sustained volatility
persisting through 2025 and 2026* as the market awaits new liquefaction
capacity from Qatar and the United States. Regarding adaptation to the
interruption of Russian gas supplies, *Italy's high network and
transportation tariffs---among the highest in Europe---limit its ability
to position itself as an exporting country* to Eastern and Central
European nations, such as Austria, that were most impacted by the
suspension of Russian flows.

Overall, *our PUN projections have been revised downward*, with
reductions of approximately -2 €/MWh for 2025, -6 €/MWh for 2026, and
over 5 €/MWh for the post-2026 period. This revision is attributed to
two primary factors. First, the anticipated decline in power demand
throughout the forecast horizon limits the operability of CCGTs, thereby
leading to a *reduction in Clean Spark Spread (CSS) expectations for
thermoelectric plants*. Second, *adjustments in gas logistic component*
for the 2025--2030 period have contributed to the downward revision,
including the stabilization of the CRVOS reimbursement mechanism---which
thermoelectric plants can claim and will remain unchanged for the next
five years---and the elimination of the CRVBL component, previously
established to cover gas balancing costs, which has now been set to
zero.

In line with IIIQ24 projections, *we anticipate a rebound in the PUN in
2025 to 112 €/MWh*, driven by potential *tensions in the gas market* and
CO2 prices remaining around 85 €/ton, reflecting the *full
implementation of the ETS reform*. However, with the continued
integration of RES capacity, further price normalization post-2026, and
sustained levels of electricity imports, we project *prices to fall
below 100 €/MWh by 2029* in the Reference scenario and by 2026 in the
High RES case.

The reference scenario predicts a 0.4% year-on-year GDP growth in 2024,
with a stronger increase of 1% in 2025, driven by an anticipated easing
of financial conditions. A gradual easing of monetary policies in the
second half of the year, along with positive wage dynamics, should
contribute to growth in 2025. In the worst-case scenario, if
inflationary pressures persist, GDP is projected to decline by 0.1%
year-on-year in 2024 and see a modest increase of 0.3% in 2025.
Conversely, the best-case scenario, characterized by accelerated
disinflation and a recovery in investments, would result in GDP growth
of up to 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.

to support investments, following the reduction in inflation risk. The
path to monetary normalization remains uncertain, though, as the
decisions of the two Central Banks are highly dependent on economic
outcomes. Geopolitical uncertainty could further weigh on the inflation
outlook, as new disruptions in the production and transportation chains
of imported goods may increase pressure on inflation.

Global LNG demand is projected to grow nearly 5% in 2024, with potential
acceleration in 2025 as regasification capacity increases. This growth
will mainly stem from European and Chinese demand as LNG intake rises to
support the transition from coal. While global LNG supply growth will be
limited in 2024, reduced competition between Europe and Asia and new
capacity entering the market in 2025 should provide adequate coverage.

In our Reference scenario, the TTF yearly average for 2024 and 2025 is
projected to remain below €40/MWh, with subdued demand putting downward
pressure on prices. Europe's LNG import capacity is poised to expand by
a further 30 Bcm in 2024, enabling additional LNG arrivals, which will
be crucial for maintaining market equilibrium in the short-term and

We expect the 2024 PSV yearly average to remain below €40/MWh due to
limited recovery in gas demand. The transition towards savings and
efficiency impacts distribution network consumption, while slow growth
in the energy-intensive sector restricts industrial demand, contributing
to below-average thermoelectric gas consumption. Additionally, delays in
the commissioning of the Ravenna FSRU have hindered expectations for gas

### Logistics Costs for Italian Gas-Fired Units

The 2023 logistic cost for Italian gas-fired units averaged 4 €/MWh amid
the increase of the CRVOS (which pays storage injections incentives),
CRVBL (which covers the charges associated with the gas system balancing
activity) and the CVU (which covers variable charges and it's linked to
the gas price trend) components. The variable logistic cost remains
around 4 €/MWh short-term due to the essential CRVOS component for
storage injection incentives, though thermoelectric producers could
request over 60% exemption from October 2024 (ARERA Resolution
384/2024). The remaining losses stemmed from extra cost derived from
2022 emergency gas purchases to rebuild storages (nearly 5 Bln€) will be
recovered through final customers' bills over five years. The ARERA
Resolution 263/2024 temporary fixes the CRVBL component (which covers
the charges associated with the gas system balancing activity) equal to
zero from January 2025, as a result of the improved natural gas price
scenario. As a precautionary measure, we assume a gradual return to
historical average levels in the second half of 2025 to account for the
volatility of the current transport cost environment, which reverberates
on prices consequently.

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference scenario, the average CO2 price for 2024 is projected
to remain around 70 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the
ETS reform. The phasing out of free allowances for aviation (50% by
2025) and the removal of 90 million permits in 2024 are expected to put
upward pressure on allowance prices by reducing supply. From 2025
onward, the inclusion of the maritime transport sector will further
increase demand. However, concerns linger about the pace of demand
recovery, which is expected to be slow due to ongoing economic
challenges.
:::

The supply-demand gap is expected to widen starting in 2026 as the
maritime sector joins the ETS and the phasing out of free aviation
allowances is fully implemented. By 2030, the Market Stability Reserve's
reinforcement and an increase in the Linear Reduction Factor to 4.4%
will further tighten the market, pushing the average CO2 price towards
110 €/ton.

330 TWh by 2030. In the High RES scenario, a stronger economic outlook
and accelerated electrification drive demand to nearly 350 TWh by 2030.
Conversely, in the Low RES scenario, slower economic recovery (averaging

2025, 4.5 million by 2030, and 11.1 million by 2040 in the Reference

from EVs, respectively. In the High RES scenario, a more rapid adoption
of electric vehicles is expected to reach 6 million by 2030 and 15
million by 2040. Conversely, in the Low RES scenario, the development of
e-mobility experiences a 5- to 10-year delay compared to the Reference

The NIECP envisages 6.5 million electric vehicles in Italy in 2030 - 4.3
million are pure EVs (BEV: Battery Electric Vehicles) -- accounting for
about 8 TWh of additional electricity demand. In our Reference view we
estimate additional 7.5 TWh to come from BEV and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid
Electric Vehicle). This means that our hypotheses consider a greater
consumption per EV compared to NIECP figures. Main differences are most

In 2015, the approval of the European guidelines on capacity allocation
and congestion management (CACM) introduced new parameters to be
followed in the zonal configuration review process. In 2018, Terna began
a process to review the zonal configurations in compliance with such
rules.
:::

The current zonal configuration derives from the base case proposed by
Terna in compliance with the CACM. Differences compared to the previous
configuration: (i) elimination of the limited production poles, (ii)
inclusion of a new bidding zone corresponding to the Calabria region,
(iii) displacement of the Umbria region from the Centre-North zone to
the Centre-South market zone.

electricity needs is as follows: North (57%), Central-North (9%),
Central-South (17%), South (7%), Calabria (2%), Sicily (6%), Sardinia

## Net Import

**THE RECOVERY OF NUCLEAR CAPACITY FROM O&M OPERATIONS INITIATED IN 2022
(ALONG WITH THE CONNECTION OF THE FLAMANVILLE REACTOR AFTER LONG

ELECTRICITY DEMAND ACROSS EUROPE, IS EXPECTED TO SUSTAIN NET IMPORTS
INTO THE NORTHERN ZONE. NET IMPORTS ARE PROJECTED TO REACH 50 TWH BY THE
END OF 2024. AFTER 2029, THE COMPLETION OF A 600 MW INTERCONNECTOR WITH
TUNISIA (MONTEL) WILL ENHANCE EXPORT CAPABILITIES.**
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 25-26 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Building on the trends observed in 2023 and 2024, net imports from
neighboring countries are expected to remain above the historical
average in the short term. This sustained level is primarily attributed
to the ongoing recovery of French nuclear power production following two
years of operation and maintenance disruptions, enhanced hydroelectric
output in Switzerland, and a slower-than-anticipated rebound in European
electricity demand. Net imports are projected to reach 49.4 TWh in 2025,
with a slight reduction to 48.9 TWh in 2026, accounting for nearly 16%
of short-term electricity demand.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 27-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The persistent combination of subdued electricity demand and ongoing
expansion of renewable energy capacity across Europe is anticipated to
result in systemic overgeneration in the medium term, reinforcing
imports as a cost-efficient option for Italy. This is further supported
by the projection that the PUN will remain at a premium compared to
other European prices over the same horizon. Net imports are expected to
stabilize at an average of approximately 49 TWh annually through 2029.
However, with the commissioning of the Elmed interconnection linking
Sicily and Tunisia by late 2028, the net import balance is projected to
decrease to around 45 TWh, as over 3.5 TWh of electricity is redirected
for export.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Import levels are expected to remain stable also after 2030, ranging
above 45 TWh. The slight increase in net import seen from 2035 is due to
an estimated reduction (1 TWh ca.) in the export flows towards Tunisia,
following the implementation of the Tunisian system development plan.

![](figs/36_Day_Ahead_Market_Overgen.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 25-26 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Under BAU market conditions and moderate renewable penetration, the risk
of overgeneration remains low in both the Reference and Low RES
scenarios. However, a more significant increase in capacity installation
in the South macro-zone could lead to more frequent overgeneration
during specific hours in the High RES scenario.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 27-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The anticipated increase in renewable energy penetration after 2027 is
expected to heighten the risk of overgeneration, potentially resulting
in approximately 3 TWh of excess electricity by 2030 in the High RES
scenario. This curtailment effect could be further amplified by specific
local grid constraints. In comparison, the Reference scenario projects a
more moderate level of overgeneration, reaching around 0.7 TWh by 2030.
Overall, overgeneration is set to escalate throughout the decade, driven
by the rapid expansion of renewables in the Southern regions, and could
be exacerbated by delays or inadequacies in grid reinforcement.
:::
:::

::: callout-item

To effectively manage the increasing penetration of renewable energy and
the resulting overgeneration, substantial investments in grid
reinforcement and high-capacity energy storage solutions will be
essential throughout the 2030s. These measures will be critical for
balancing the grid and maintaining a stable energy supply, particularly
in regions more susceptible to overgeneration. Additionally, this excess
energy production presents an opportunity to expand electrolysis
capacity, which would not only harness surplus energy but also support
continued investments in renewable energy sources.

In the long term, the expansion of renewable capacity---particularly in
the Southern regions---is expected to significantly increase the
incidence of systematic overgeneration, especially on the islands. Grid
investments and battery energy storage systems (BESS) will likely prove
inadequate to address this issue, thereby creating favorable conditions
for the adoption of green hydrogen technologies. In the Reference
scenario, installed electrolysis capacity could reach nearly 0.5 GW,
predominantly concentrated in Sardinia. Over time, electrolysis capacity
can effectively mitigate overgeneration by offering a mechanism to store
surplus renewable energy. Moreover, by enhancing demand during periods
of high RES production, it can help stabilize prices and alleviate the
cannibalization effect, particularly during the later stages of the
transition.

Despite potential challenges in securing land and rising land costs,
technology costs for solar projects have decreased over the past year.
This reduction has been primarily driven by declining panel costs,
supported by increased competition among sellers. These trends are
supporting the market parity for solar technologies, with baseload
prices projected to stabilize between 80 and 100€/MWh during the
2025-2026 period. As a result, solar power plants are expected to
capture rates that exceed the estimated levelized cost of electricity
(LCOE), ranging between 66 and 82 €/MWh, depending on the market zone.

Market parity continues to be guaranteed for wind plants despite the
investement intensity of those projects, benefitting of their wider
generation profile capable of capturing higher prices than solar plants.
This is largely due to their broader generation profile, which allows
wind projects to capture higher prices compared to solar plants. With
annual captured prices aligning closely with baseload prices, wind power
plants are expected to cover LCOE levels ranging between 85 and 90
€/MWh, in all the zones.

an ambitious target of 72 GWh of additional storage capacity by 2030,
spanning both utility-scale and distributed projects. Utility-scale
development will primarily focus on Southern regions, where
non-programmable renewable generation is most concentrated. The Italian
storage market currently boasts a substantial pipeline of projects,
either authorized or under evaluation, with their realization heavily
reliant on the support of regulated mechanisms. Key among these is the
MACSE auction, planned for mid-2025, which aims to develop capacity
predominantly in the South and on the islands. By 2030, total BESS

Post-2030, the decommissioning of aging capacity will enable existing
CCGTs (53%-efficiency) to remain the marginal technology for
approximately 80% of the operating hours through 2040. During this
horizon, baseload CSS is expected to range below -2 €/MWh, and until -6
€/MWh. In the High RES scenario, baseload CSS is projected to fall
further, staying below -7 €/MWh in the long-term (post-2040).
Conversely, in the Low RES, increased CCGT generation will result in
higher baseload CSS, though it is still expected to remain below -4
€/MWh from 2040 onwards.

**IN THE NEAR TERM, CURRENT UNITS ARE LIKELY TO FACE LESS FAVORABLE
SWITCHING CONDITIONS, BUT THE RISING SOLAR PENETRATION IS PROJECTED TO
INCREASE EVENING PRICE PEAKS OVER THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM.

Captured CSS evolve depending on the zone mix, with southern bidding
zones suffering the high operativity of coal-fired units and significant
risk of operation at loss, while CCGT producing in the northern zone
manage to guarantee positive margins at around 11 €/MWh , favored by the
current market dynamics.

As renewable capacity increases, existing units tend to concentrate
their operations during evening hours to maximize captured margins. The
high-efficiency gas-fired capacity captured CSS is subject to
competitive market conditions as new projects enter the market with
support from the latest CM auction. Despite this, the high efficiency of
these projects enables them to maintain an average captured margin of 10
€/MWh.

Growing renewable penetration intensifies overgeneration phenomena and
accentuates evening price spikes, determining an increasing trend for
captured marginality for existing units in the first half of the 2030s,
but load factors reduce progressively on increasing renewables share and
increase competition from high efficiency units.

## Captured Prices of Renewable Sources

### Solar Captured Prices

::: callout-main
**A GROWING CANNIBALIZATION EFFECT ON SOLAR PRICES BECOMES APPARENT IN
THE LATE 2020s, PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN MARKET ZONES, WHERE HIGH
RENEWABLE PENETRATION AND LIMITED INTERCONNECTION CAPACITY WITH NORTHERN
ZONES EXACERBATE THE IMPACT**
:::

![](figs/52_Solar_Captured_Prices_ref.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 25-26 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Solar power plants stand to benefit from projected moderate increases in
power prices, with captured prices varying between approximately 94€/MWh
and 100€/MWh in the Northern zone, depending on the technology (Tracker
or Fixed Tilt). In the Southern zones, captured prices range between
77€/MWh and 88€/MWh.

The accelerating rate of RES installations, along with the resulting
cannibalization and overgeneration effects --- only partially mitigated
by energy storage systems and grid improvements --- is influencing zonal
captured prices. These prices are diverging from baseload prices and are
projected to fall below 90 €/MWh by 2030, even in the Northern zones.

The growing frequency of overgeneration highlights the need for
energy-intensive storage systems to partially mitigate the
cannibalization effect. After 2030, this effect intensifies for solar
captured prices, especially in Southern market zones with higher
renewable penetration, driving long-term prices below 50 €/MWh in both
Northern and Southern regions.

Captured prices remain closely aligned with zonal baseload prices over
the long term. Increased solar production leads to overgeneration in the
early 2030s, but outcomes for both sources are shaped more by zonal
market dynamics than price trends. By 2030, captured prices exceed 95
€/MWh in the Northern zones and approach 90 €/MWh in the South,
supported by a more balanced production profile across the day and year.

### Investment costs and IRR of Solar and Wind

::: callout-main
**INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE PV MODULES MARKET DRIVES DOWN INVESTMENT
COSTS FOR SOLAR IN THE MID AND LONG TERM, EVEN THOUGH GRID CONNECTION
AND LAND COSTS MAY RISE. HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR WIND**
:::

![](figs/59_Capex_Wind.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### Solar {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The high competition in the PV modules market, predominantly led by
Chinese manufacturers, has driven the costs of PV modules down to around
€150,000 per MW. Nearly 30% of the total cost for a module is attributed
to polysilicon, a relatively inexpensive but highly volatile material.
Other critical materials with high demand and low availability, such as
silver, could potentially increase the price of the technology in the
future. Generally, due to market competitiveness, PV modules account for
only 15% of the total solar CAPEX. Two significant costs impact the
total CAPEX for solar technologies. The cost of connecting to the grid,
which varies greatly by project, is expected to rise in the coming
years. This is due to the increasing number of projects in remote
locations, complicating high-voltage grid connections. Additionally, the
cost of land acquisition or rental, which constitutes nearly 8% of the
total cost, has increased in recent years. The anticipated acceleration
of new installations in the coming years may further drive up land
demand for solar projects, as available sites diminish, thereby
increasing rental costs. This cost structure typically results in an IRR
of around 7% (base case considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices,
30 years time horizon) for solar projects, with regional variations
according to different zonal captured prices. For agri-voltaic projects,
a markup of 20%-40% on the total investment cost must be applied,
leading to a lower expected IRR of around 6%.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### Wind {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The primary cost for a wind plant is the turbine and inverter, which
account for 60% of the total cost. Grid connection represents 10% of the
wind CAPEX, which is approximately €1.5 million for an onshore wind
project. In the short and mid-term, technology costs are unlikely to
decrease due to the low rate of new installations, which limits the
potential for economies of scale. However, as the technology matures,
particularly in Northern countries where installation rates are higher,
there may be a reduction in technology costs. Despite this, the CAPEX
for a wind project is expected to remain above €1 million until 2040.
This cost structure typically results in an IRR of around 7% (base case
considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices, 20 years time horizon)
for onshore wind projects.

### Hydro Run-of-River Captured Prices

Captured prices are expected to remain closely aligned with zonal
baseload prices in the long term. The overgeneration resulting from
increased solar production significantly influences the early 2030s;
however, the performance of both sources remains more closely tied to
zonal market dynamics than to changes in price structure. Additionally,
both sources benefit from a production profile that is more evenly
distributed throughout the day and across the year.

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to partially
recover from 2022 but will remain below historical levels due to: (i)
availability of thermoelectric reserves, (ii) changes in network
management practices by Terna since the 2022 cost-containment scheme,
and (iii) feasibility intervals imposed on power plants under the new
Intra-Day Market structure.

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 27-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The exit of coal-fired units on the mainland and the progressive
increase in the energy mix of renewable production are compensated by
the entry of (i) new thermoelectric and energy intensive storage
capacity sustained by the CM mechanism, and (ii) the diffusion of power
intensive BESS that are going to reduce the need of ex ante scheduling,
given the availability of flexible resources in the system.
:::

The increasing share of renewables in the energy mix will be balanced by
(i) the
addition of new thermoelectric capacity and storage systems supported by
the
Capacity Market mechanism and MACSE. This is expected to reduce the need
for
ex-ante scheduling, thanks to the greater availability of flexible
resources within the system.

In the High RES scenario, the swift expansion of non-programmable
renewable generation is mitigated by advancements in grid infrastructure
and the accelerated deployment of energy-intensive storage solutions. In
contrast, the Low RES scenario sees the proliferation of less flexible
resources, thereby increasing the demand for additional volumes in the
Market for Secondary Reserves.

In the High RES scenario, continued grid development and significant
growth in energy-intensive storage assets contribute to limiting ASM
volumes. In contrast, in the Low RES scenario, ASM volumes remain stable
due to a greater presence of CCGT in the Day-Ahead Market and the
continued operation of coal plants until 2035. Additionally, the
development of energy-intensive storage facilitates better regulation of
the system.

# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2024-2050 (with projections up to
2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of
proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural
models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of
regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our
elaborations.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and
economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and
fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the
pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of
the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables
in line with the historical average trend.

In this perspective, we defined three scenarios:

-   The **High Case scenario** is characterized by permanently high
    fuels and power prices amid negative or zero economic growth
    depressing investments and weighing on the energy transition
    process.\

-   In the **Reference scenario**, is characterized by the energy
    transition process progress leading to a diversification of energy
    sources supported by the existing policies. This, combined with
    efficiency maintains the energy market on a transformation path. The
    economic growth slowly recovers over the next two years.

-   The **Low Case scenario** would materialize in the event of
    favorable weather conditions and a fast energy transition, supported
    by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing power and
    fossil fuels demand over the next few years. This would limit energy
    prices upside potential and then fuel a downward acceleration.

# Macroeconomic Context

## GDP

::: callout-main
**GDP GROWTH IN THE SHORT TERM REMAINS SUBDUED, WITH A MODERATE RECOVERY
IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ANTICIPATED, SUPPORTED BY WAGE DYNAMICS AND THE
EASING OF MONETARY POLICIES. IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM, GROWTH
PROSPECTS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE PATH OF DISINFLATION, EASING
FINANCING CONDITIONS, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NRRP**
:::

![](figs/10_Italian_GDP_Growth_Rate.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The reference scenario predicts a 0.4% year-on-year GDP growth in 2024,
with a stronger increase of 1% in 2025, driven by an anticipated easing
of financial conditions. A gradual easing of monetary policies in the
second half of the year, along with positive wage dynamics, should
contribute to growth in 2025. In the worst-case scenario, if
inflationary pressures persist, GDP is projected to decline by 0.1%
year-on-year in 2024 and see a modest increase of 0.3% in 2025.
Conversely, the best-case scenario, characterized by accelerated
disinflation and a recovery in investments, would result in GDP growth
of up to 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference and Best scenarios, economic growth would gradually
realign to the previously projected path, sustained by the effective
implementation of the NRRP measures, the recovery of the global economy,
and an acceleration of the green transition reforms.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In the long-term, our Reference and Best-case scenarios remain anchored
to the assumption of a stabilization of the yearly GDP growth rate in
the 1-2% interval, while in the Worst scenario, GDP growth continues to
discount the effects of the failure of key investments.
:::
:::

::: callout-wrap
::: callout-left
#### Main updates {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Short-term GDP projections were revised upward, as a faster than
expected disinflation and the probable easing of monetary policies
combined with positive wage dynamics contribute to GDP growth.

## Inflation rate

::: callout-main
**THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ENERGY PRICES NORMALIZATION IS DRIVING THE
GENERAL PRICE INDEX DECLINE, WITH ITS REDUCTION BEGINNING TO TRANSMIT
ALSO TO THE CORE INDEX. MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING PROVED TO BE
EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES AND KEEPING MEDIUM AND LONG
TERM EXPECTATIONS UNDER CONTROL**
:::

![](figs/11_Inflation_rate.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Inflation is expected to remain close to 2% both in 2024 and 2025, with
the ongoing disinflation path expected to gradually ease as the
carry-over effect of declining energy prices diminish and the monetary
policy stance reverts. Since mid-2024, the European Central Bank and the
Federal Reserve have indeed approved the first cuts to reference rates
to support investments, following the reduction in inflation risk. The
path to monetary normalization remains uncertain, though, as the
decisions of the two Central Banks are highly dependent on economic
outcomes. Geopolitical uncertainty could further weigh on the inflation
outlook, as new disruptions in the production and transportation chains
of imported goods may increase pressure on inflation.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Still relatively high interest rates are seen as proving effective in
guiding inflation back to 2% in the short term. Our scenario foresees a
stabilization at 2% in the second part of the decade, even with a
gradual easing of monetary policy, although the risk of further pressure
on prices due to the expected easing of monetary policy.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}

Long-term assumptions envisage the inflation rate to stabilize at around
2%, in line with the ECB’s medium term inflation target.

### LNG

::: callout-main
**GLOBAL LNG DEMAND IS SEEN AS GROWING STEADILY IN THE SHORT TERM, WITH
A NOTABLE DISPARITY IN GROWTH RATE SHOWCASED BETWEEN THE ASIAN AND
EUROPEAN BLOCS. DELAYS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIQUEFACTION AND
REGASIFICATION CAPACITY, INDUCED BY LOW PRICES, COULD TRANSLATE IN
RENEWED DEMAND-SUPPLY TENSIONS IN 2025-2026. THERE IS A HIGH PROPABILITY
OF AN OVERSUPPLIED MARKET POST-2026 LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR LNG PRICES
NORMALIZING IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM**
:::

![](figs/12_World_LNG_Demand.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
European and Chinese gas demand will primarily drive this uprise, as LNG
intake is expected to accelerate in the short-term, in response to
expansion of regasification capacity, and to support the transition from
coal. Despite 2024 LNG supply growth being limited globally, reduced
competition between Europe and Asia, and the expected new capacity
entering the market in 2025, are likely to guarantee adequate demand
coverage.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Starting from 2026, LNG demand growth is expected to gradually slowdown,
stabilizing just below 5% y/y, consistently with rising renewable energy
production and improved energy efficiency measures. Conditional on the
lack of further delays, a new wave of liquefaction capacity will enter
the market by 2026, driven by US and Qatar, contributing to almost
eliminating the risk of market tightness.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}

### TTF Price

::: callout-main
**THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEMAND RETURNING TO PRE-CRISIS LEVELS WITHIN THE
NEXT THREE YEARS IS CONSIDERED LOW, WITH THE SAVINGS PUT IN PLACE IN
RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN GAS HALT LEADING TO STRUCTURAL CHANGES. IN THE
LONG TERM, WE ANTICIPATE FURTHER DEMAND REDUCTION DUE TO EUROPE'S
DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS, LEADING TO A LOWER TTF PRICE TRAJECTORY NEARING
25€/MWH. PRICE TENSION AND VOLATILITY SPIKES, PARTICULARLY DURING
WINTERS, MAY OCCUR OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THOUGH**
:::

![](figs/12_TTF_Price.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference scenario, the projected average TTF price for 2024 is
expected to remain below €40/MWh, primarily due to sustained low demand
impacting prices. Additionally, Europe’s LNG import capacity is set to
increase by 30 Bcm in 2024, facilitating additional LNG shipments. This
expansion is crucial for maintaining market stability in the short term
and for adapting to the ongoing reduction of Russian piped gas supplies.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
From 2026 onwards, a further normalization is anticipated as a result of
the significant deployment of new liquefaction capacity. Assuming a
progressive growth of global LNG supplies alongside an acceleration of
the energy transition, European gas prices are projected to steadily
decrease towards 30 €/MWh by 2028.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-40 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The European decarbonization process would keep reducing gas demand,
successively pressuring the price action back towards the 25 €/MWh
long-term equilibrium. Only in the High scenario, persisting
geopolitical and commercial tensions would leave commodities shortages
unresolved, leaving prices just below 45 €/MWh in the long-term.
Effective green policies supported by economic growth may lead prices
significantly lower in the Low scenario, with the TTF averaging near 10
€/MWh in the long-term.

### Spread TTF-PSV

::: callout-main
**IN THE SHORT-TO-MEDIUM TERM THE PSV GAS PRICE IS ANTICIPATED TO
MAINTAIN A PREMIUM COMPARED TO THE TTF, FOLLOWING THE NEED FOR NORTHERN
EUROPE GAS FLOWS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INTERRUPTION OF RUSSIAN PIPED GAS
SUPPLIES. THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE OLT LNG REGASIFICATION FACILITY
IN ITALY ADDS PRESSURE IN THE VERY NEAR-TERM. IN THE LONG-TERM, THE
REBALANCING OF FLOWS IS SEEN AS LEADING TO A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF
THE SPREAD TOWARDS ZERO**
:::

![](figs/14_Spread_TTF_PSV.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The PSV-TTF spread is expected to stay just below 3 €/MWh in 2024
following the closure of the OLT LNG regasification facility which
increases the Italy’s reliance on piped gas flows from Norway via Passo
Gries. Fluctuations throughout the year are anticipated to be in line
with seasonality.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Flows from the TAP and Algeria, and LNG arrivals are seen as partially
taking over imports from the North in the medium-term, leading to a
progressive spread closure to below 1 €/MWh by 2030.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The PSV-TTF spread is foreseen to reabsorb towards zero in the
long-term, with the completion of flows rebalancing from North to South
and LNG expected to combine with the underlying decarbonization-induced
demand reduction.
:::
:::

::: callout-wrap
::: callout-left
#### Main updates {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
PSV-TTF spread is still expected to remain positive in short and medium
term and to reduce progressively towards null in the long-run. A slight
increase in the short-term average PSV-TTF spread follows OLT facility
temporary halt, coherently with our expectations.
:::

### PSV Price

::: callout-main
**THE ITALIAN GAS PRICE CONTINUES TO BE CLOSELY TIED TO THE EUROPEAN HUB
ONE, WITH THE TTF SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING PSV TRENDS. HOWEVER, THE
TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OLT LNG FACILITY LEADS TO SHORT-TERM PROJECTIONS
SUGGESTING WIDER DEVIATIONS FROM THE TTF. IN THE LONG RUN, WE FORESEE
THE PSV TO ALIGN WITH THE EUROPEAN PRICES, TARGETING 30 €/MWH BY 2030**
:::

![](figs/15_PSV_Price.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
We anticipate a 2024 PSV yearly average below 40 €/MWh, amid constrained
gas demand recovery. The shift towards savings and efficiency weights on
distribution network consumption, while subdued growth in the
energy-intensive sector limits the industrial demand adding to a
lower-than-average thermoelectric gas demand. Delays in the
commissioning of the Ravenna FSRU have also hampered gas demand recovery
expectations. In the event of renewed tensions on LNG and TTF prices
arising in winter 25-26, the PSV would follow.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The PSV is foreseen to follow the European gas prices mid-term
normalization towards 30 €/MWh by year 2030, as a gradual rebalancing of

### Logistics Costs for Italian Gas-Fired Units

The 2023 logistic cost for Italian gas-fired units averaged 4 €/MWh amid
the increase of the CRVOS (which pays storage injections incentives),
CRVBL (which covers the charges associated with the gas system balancing
activity) and the CVU (which covers variable charges and it’s linked to
the gas price trend) components. The variable logistic cost remains
around 4 €/MWh short-term due to the essential CRVOS component for
storage injection incentives, though thermoelectric producers could
request over 60% exemption. The ARERA Resolution 263/2024 temporary
fixes the CRVBL component (which covers the charges associated with the
gas system balancing activity) equal to zero from January 2025, as a
result of the improved natural gas price scenario. As a precautionary
measure, we assume a gradual return to historical average levels in the
second half of 2025 to account for the volatility of the current
transport cost environment, which reverberates on prices consequently.

In our Reference scenario, the 2024 CO2 price average is projected to
stay near 70 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the ETS
system reform. The phasing out of free allowances for the aviation
sector, reaching 50% of the total in 2025, are expected to begin
exerting upward pressure on allowances prices by curtailing supply. From
2025 onwards, the progressive inclusion of the maritime transport sector
will further boost overall demand.

The widening of the supply-demand gap should become evident starting

phasing out of free allowances for aviation reaches full implementation.
By 2030, the reinforcement of the Market Stability Reserve and the
increase of the Linear Reduction Factor up to 4.4% will contribute to
further tightening the market. As a result, the CO2 price is expected to
accelerate towards 110 €/ton on average by 2030.

By 2034 the removal of free allowances for sectors covered by the CBAM

allowances demand. The long-term targets would hinge upon the effective
efficiency of the ETS System, with the CO2 price expected to exceed 120
€/ton in the Reference scenario by 2040, and potentially accelerate to
just below 150 €/ton in the Low scenario.

The reduction in electricity demand across Europe, combined with
supply-side overgeneration driven by the recovery of nuclear plant
capacity after two years of maintenance and an increase in hydroelectric
production, has led to a rise in electricity imports from the northern
borders. This phenomenon is expected to continue in the short term.
Additionally, the positive trend in the installation of new renewable
energy sources (RES) observed in 2023 and the first half of 2024 is
anticipated to persist, with gas-fired thermal plants maintaining their

A rapid surge in decarbonization efforts is driven by rising commodity

new renewable projects, all of which collectively boost investment in
energy efficiency. The phase-out of coal-fired units across the

By the end of 2028 coal-fired units are entirely phased-out. Falling

A modest economic recovery is anticipated over the next two years,
resulting in an increase in electricity demand, projected to reach
nearly 316 TWh by 2025 (+1.1% year-on-year). Positive growth is also
expected in alternative scenarios: in the high case scenario, demand is
estimated at 312 TWh, reflecting a lower rate of economic recovery,

from EVs, respectively. In the Low scenario, a more rapid adoption of
electric vehicles is expected to reach 6 million by 2030 and 15 million
by 2040. Conversely, in the High scenario, the development of e-mobility
experiences a 5- to 10-year delay compared to the Reference scenario,

Under BAU market conditions and moderate renewable penetration, the risk
of overgeneration remains limited in both the Reference and High cases.
However, a more pronounced increase in capacity installation in the

during certain hours in the Low case scenario.
:::
:::

The increased penetration of renewable energy sources expected after
2027 is likely to raise the risk of overgeneration, potentially leading
to around 2 TWh of excess electricity in the Low scenario by 2030. The
curtailment effect may become more pronounced under specific local grid
conditions. In contrast, the Reference scenario anticipates a more
moderate level of overgeneration, approaching 0.5 TWh by 2030. Overall,
during this decade, overgeneration is expected to intensify due to the
rapid expansion of renewable energy in the Southern regions of the
country, and it could be exacertbated if coupled with insufficient grid
reinforcement.

essential throughout the 2030s. These measures will be critical for
balancing the grid and maintaining a stable energy supply, particularly
in regions more susceptible to overgeneration. Additionally, this excess

In the long term, the expansion of renewable capacity—particularly in

of systematic overgeneration, especially on the islands. Grid
investments and battery energy storage systems (BESS) will likely prove
inadequate to address this issue, thereby creating favorable conditions
for the adoption of green hydrogen technologies. In the Reference
scenario, installed electrolysis capacity could reach nearly 0.5 GW,
predominantly concentrated in Sardinia. Over time, electrolysis capacity
can effectively mitigate overgeneration by offering a mechanism to store
surplus renewable energy. Moreover, by enhancing demand during periods
of high renewable energy source (RES) production, it can help stabilize
prices and alleviate the cannibalization effect, particularly during the

The stabilization of commodity prices, elevated net imports from foreign
countries, and a weak recovery of demand are intensifying market

-2.5 €/MWh is projected for thermal plants in the Reference scenario for
2025.

In the second half of the 2020s, existing CCGTs are poised to benefit
from the phase-out of coal-fired units. Coupled with a recovery in
electricity demand, this is anticipated to enhance baseload CSS, which

::: callout-item
::: callout-left

Network congestion is generally not a significant problem on the
mainland. With electricity demand remaining below historical levels and
renewable generation increasing gradually, prices in the Southern
regions are lower. Meanwhile, increased CCGT operations in the Northern
zones contribute to prices exceeding the PUN, aligning with recent
historical trends.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Surging renewable penetration is projected to increase inter-zonal
congestion until 2030, when the completion of the Adriatic Link is
expected to help alleviate this issue on the mainland and improve energy
exchanges from south to north. However, a further expansion of renewable
energy sources in the Southern zones is likely to lead to more frequent
instances of congestion over time, upsurging the incidence of price
spreads.

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The spread between the PUN and the Southern market zones is expected to
remain at recent historical levels in the short term, with the Southern
zone experiencing a discount. This dynamic is driven by a general
decrease in electricity demand and an increasing share of renewable
energy sources (RES) in the generation mix, leading to lower prices
compared to the Northern zones. Despite the rise in import flows, CCGTs
in the North are still needed to meet demand, resulting in average
prices that are higher.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In both the Reference and Low cases, the incorporation of renewable
technologies results in a wider spread, despite network interventions.
Conversely, in the High scenario, the spread decreases due to more
restrained growth in renewables, allowing for gradual enhancements in
the operational conditions of gas-fired units until 2030, when coal
generation becomes less competitive compared to gas.
:::

In the Reference case, the significant penetration of renewables in
Southern regions increases the spread during the first half of the
2030s, signaling the market for new electrochemical battery energy
storage systems (BESS) to enter and prompting new grid investments. In
the Low scenario, the expected and accelerated development of storage
and network investments contributes to a reduction in the spread.
However, ongoing growth in renewable energy sources causes the spread to
widen again in the second half of the 2030s.

Market competition is expected to increase with the import flows
stabilization from the northern borders, the rise in renewable capacity,

### Investment costs and IRR of Solar and Wind

**INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE PV MODULES MARKET DRIVES DOWN INVESTMENT

![](figs/59_Capex_Wind.png)

::: callout-item

#### Solar {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The high competition in the PV modules market, predominantly led by
Chinese manufacturers, has driven the costs of PV modules down to around
€150,000 per MW. Nearly 30% of the total cost for a module is attributed
to polysilicon, a relatively inexpensive but highly volatile material.
Other critical materials with high demand and low availability, such as
silver, could potentially increase the price of the technology in the
future. Generally, due to market competitiveness, PV modules account for
only 15% of the total solar CAPEX. Two significant costs impact the
total CAPEX for solar technologies. The cost of connecting to the grid,
which varies greatly by project, is expected to rise in the coming
years. This is due to the increasing number of projects in remote
locations, complicating high-voltage grid connections. Additionally, the
cost of land acquisition or rental, which constitutes nearly 8% of the
total cost, has increased in recent years. The anticipated acceleration
of new installations in the coming years may further drive up land
demand for solar projects, as available sites diminish, thereby
increasing rental costs. This cost structure typically results in an IRR
of around 7% (base case considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices,
30 years time horizon) for solar projects, with regional variations
according to different zonal captured prices. For agri-voltaic projects,
a markup of 20%-40% on the total investment cost must be applied,
leading to a lower expected IRR of around 6%.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### Wind {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The primary cost for a wind plant is the turbine and inverter, which
account for 60% of the total cost. Grid connection represents 10% of the
wind CAPEX, which is approximately €1.5 million for an onshore wind
project. In the short and mid-term, technology costs are unlikely to
decrease due to the low rate of new installations, which limits the
potential for economies of scale. However, as the technology matures,
particularly in Northern countries where installation rates are higher,
there may be a reduction in technology costs. Despite this, the CAPEX
for a wind project is expected to remain above €1 million until 2040.
This cost structure typically results in an IRR of around 7% (base case
considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices, 20 years time horizon)
for onshore wind projects.

# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2024-2050 (with projections up to
2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of
proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural
models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of
regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our
elaborations.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and
economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and
fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the
pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of
the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables
in line with the historical average trend.

In this perspective, we defined three scenarios:

-   The **High Case scenario** is characterized by permanently high
    fuels and power prices amid negative or zero economic growth
    depressing investments and weighing on the energy transition
    process.\

-   In the **Reference scenario**, is characterized by the energy
    transition process progress leading to a diversification of energy
    sources supported by the existing policies. This, combined with
    efficiency maintains the energy market on a transformation path. The
    economic growth slowly recovers over the next two years.

-   The **Low Case scenario** would materialize in the event of
    favorable weather conditions and a fast energy transition, supported
    by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing power and
    fossil fuels demand over the next few years. This would limit energy
    prices upside potential and then fuel a downward acceleration.

## The Outlook for Italy's Energy Market Amid

Regulatory Changes, Geopolitical Tensions, and RES Dynamics

### Key Insights {.unnumbered}

Following the challenging period for European energy markets between
2021 and 2023, the decarbonization of the electricity sector is now
gaining significant momentum, with renewable energy sources driving the
transformation across major European markets. In the first nine months
of 2024, electricity consumption across Europe stabilized, closely
aligning with the average levels recorded in 2023. This stability
occurred despite the ongoing downward trend in demand observed over
recent years. Factors such as slow economic growth, decreased industrial
production, and delays in the electrification process—particularly in
countries like Italy—have continued to suppress demand, especially
within energy-intensive industries. Moreover, widespread adoption of
energy-saving practices and enhanced efficiency measures have further
contributed to the reduction in electricity consumption.

![](support/01_demand.png)

Simultaneously, across most European countries—and similarly in
Italy—the proportion of renewables in the energy mix has reached
historic levels. In the first half of 2024, renewable energy sources
accounted for over 60% of Germany’s electricity consumption,
representing a nearly 10 percentage point rise compared to the same
period in 2023. This growth was primarily fueled by favorable wind
conditions and the significant expansion of photovoltaic (PV) systems.
In Spain, the energy mix was substantially influenced by a rebound in
hydroelectric production and the rapid addition of nearly 6 GW of PV
capacity in 2023. Meanwhile, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on a
Secure Electricity Supply from Renewable Energy Sources, aiming to
accelerate the deployment of renewables, reduce dependency on nuclear
power, and facilitate electricity exports to Italy. In contrast, France
remains steadfast in its reliance on nuclear energy, which continues to
provide approximately 70% of its total electricity generation.

In Italy, the notable 2023 surge in renewables (with an increase of 5.7
GW compared to the 1.5 GW/year averaged over the last five years) has
continued into 2024, marking further progress on the path to net zero.
In the first eight months of 2024, solar capacity grew by 4.3 GW, with a
monthly growth rate consistent with 2023 and a geographical distribution
of new capacity largely following historical patterns: Lazio led in
installations, followed by Piedmont, Lombardy, Sicily, and Sardinia.
Wind capacity, meanwhile, expanded by just under 500 MW in 2024,
predominantly in the Central and Southern regions, aligning with the
post-2021 trajectory (we recall that 2021 corresponds to the year of the
implementation of the “*Semplificazioni*” Decree). The positive impact
of previous regulatory simplifications in the permitting process is
evident in the advancement of authorized projects: between July and
September 2024, 2.3 GW of solar and wind projects were approved,
predominantly solar, with Puglia, Sicily, and Emilia Romagna at the
forefront. In contrast, permits have experienced a notable slowdown
Lazio and Sardinia, two regions that have led the rankings up to this
point. PAS procedures, whose scope has been broadened by the
“*Semplificazioni*” Decree, accounted for half of the approved capacity,
indicating sustained growth from 2023 on. Nevertheless, RES projects
continue to encounter connection delays, primarily due to the need to
upgrade the power grid’s capacity for increased generation. This also
highlights the importance of simplifying the permitting process.
Streamlining permitting and implementing supportive mechanisms for
distributed generation will be essential for achieving growth in line
with PNIEC targets. The latest draft of the National Energy and Climate
Plan (NECP 2024) reinforces Italy’s ambitious decarbonization goals for
the power sector, aiming for a 63% renewable share by 2030. The
regulatory landscape, however, continues to be riddled with medium- to
long-term uncertainties. The “*Aree Idonee*” Decree, which was
anticipated to expedite the authorization process, has instead
obstructed the growth of renewable energy sources (RES), as regional
authorities impose strict limitations on designated suitable areas. In a
comparable vein, the “*Testo Unico sulle Rinnovabili*” exacerbates the
complexity of the regulatory framework by imposing new qualifications
rather than effectively streamlining the permitting process. Notably,
landscape compatibility assessments have become a requirement for
specific operations that once fell under “*Edilizia libera*” (permitted
development). Furthermore, the evolutions regarding the FerX incentive
scheme amplify the uncertainty associated with the commissioning of RES
plants. As the final version of the FerX remains pending, the MASE has
recently prepared a draft temporary decree, “*FerX Transitorio*”, aimed
at launching the incentive system as quickly as possible. This Decree
establishes a support scheme for renewable sources that is valid only
until December 31, 2025. The most recent update, that is ready to be
submitted to the European Commission for validation,  allocates a quota
of 3 GW specifically for RES plants with direct access to auctions,
alongside 14.65 GW—comprised of 10 GW for solar and 4 GW for wind—for
plants participating in the public auction regime. This quota, which has
already been lowered in response to the ARERA opinion on the Decree,
signifies a notable reduction compared to the contingent set by the
definitive FER X. As for the rest, the scheme retains most of the
stipulations found in the draft of the definitive FER X, including the
exclusion from the auction participation for projects that initiated
construction operations prior to the submission of the auction
participation application. Such a stipulation may potentially hinder the
short-term momentum of plant commissioning. However, the expected impact
of the “FerX Transitorio” will likely depend on the timing of the
auctions, which are currently projected to be delayed unt

Overall, the outlook for renewable energy sources (RES) in Italy appears
promising for the coming years, despite lingering uncertainties. The
momentum gained in 2023, which has continued into early 2024, is
expected to carry through to the latter part of 2024, albeit at a more
gradual pace, stabilizing at around 2.5 GW annually (an average of 2 GW
from solar and 0.5 GW from wind) during the 2025–2026 period. A more
significant acceleration in RES installations is projected from 2027
onward, driven by the FERX initiative. However, under the Reference
scenario, only 50 GW of solar and 16 GW of wind installed capacity are
anticipated by 2030, which falls short of the PNIEC targets of 80 GW and
28 GW, respectively. This discrepancy is attributed to the current
permitting pace, which remains insufficient at approximately 9–10 GW per
year. Should there be a complete simplification of the authorization
procedures, a more efficient permitting process could enable the
installation of 63 GW of solar and 22 GW of wind by 2030 (Low Case
scenario). The recent developments in renewable energy source (RES)
regulations align with improved short-term conditions in the gas market
and an increase in renewable electricity generation. This has
contributed to a downward trend in power prices across Europe since
early 2024, a trend that has recently been intensified by spikes in
electricity demand. The IIIQ 2024 Market Report explores the long-term
risks and opportunities that lie ahead. The analysis identifies
potential pathways to decarbonization while addressing the disparities
between expected market trends and national decarbonization objectives,
underscoring the challenges that must be navigated in the future.
Short-term GDP growth remains modest, primarily driven by a gradual
recovery in industrial production, influenced by wage trends and
anticipated adjustments in monetary policy. In the Reference scenario,
GDP growth is projected to reach 0.4% year-on-year in 2024, followed by
a more robust increase of 1% in 2025, bolstered by expected improvements
in financial conditions. A lackluster industrial sector and subdued
investment are expected to hinder performance in 2024. However, a
relaxation of monetary policy in the latter half of the year, coupled
with favorable wage dynamics, is anticipated to invigorate growth in
2025. In the High case scenario, characterized by ongoing inflationary
pressures, GDP may contract by 0.1% in 2024, followed by a modest
recovery of 0.3% in 2025. In contrast, the Low case scenario—defined by
a quicker disinflation and a resurgence in investments—anticipates GDP
growth of 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. Long-term growth will hinge on
several factors, including the pace of disinflation, the enhancement of
financial conditions, and the effective execution of the National
Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). Both the Reference and Low
scenarios posit that economic growth will thrive on successful NRRP
implementation, a global economic recovery, and expedited green
transition reforms. Conversely, in the High scenario, fiscal pressures
and delays in NRRP execution may impede growth, posing risks to progress
in the green transition.

Gas prices have experienced a slight increase during the summer months
due to heightened geopolitical tensions, approaching the average levels
for the same period in 2023. However, given the current competition in
LNG supplies, along with the status of European domestic gas reserves
and demand, a significant rise in gas prices is deemed unlikely until
the upcoming winter season, barring any further deterioration in
geopolitical conditions. The extended period of low prices is delaying
the construction of liquefaction capacity, which could create renewed
supply-demand imbalances. Nevertheless, the potential for a new bullish
cycle should not be discounted, particularly beginning in the winter of
2025-2026. From 2026 onward, LNG demand growth is projected to slow to
below 5% annually, driven by an increase in renewable energy production
and enhanced energy efficiency measures. A new wave of liquefaction
capacity is expected to come online by 2026, primarily led by the United
States and Qatar, which should significantly alleviate the risk of
market shortages. While current geopolitical tensions have not yet
influenced gas market dynamics in this scenario and are not reflected in
pricing, they remain a critical risk factor that could disrupt
short-term market equilibrium. The persistently low gas demand across
Europe in 2023 has led to storage levels significantly surpassing
historical averages, which has, in turn, contributed to a decline in gas
prices. Without a resurgence in electricity demand to boost
thermoelectric gas consumption, the anticipated demand for storage
injections in 2024 is unlikely to have a substantial impact on gas
prices in the coming months. The Italian gas price remains closely
linked to the European hub, particularly the TTF. However, the temporary
suspension of operations at the OLT facility has disrupted Italian gas
imports, causing near-term projections to reflect greater discrepancies
from the TT

In our Reference scenario, the yearly averages for both PSV and TTF in
2024 stay below 42 €/MWh, reflecting the effects of limited gas demand
recovery, shift towards savings and efficiency reducing pressure on
distribution networks. Additionally, subdued growth in the
energy-intensive sector limits industrial demand, resulting in
lower-than-average thermoelectric gas demand. Delays in the
commissioning of the Ravenna FSRU have tempered expectations for a
recovery in gas demand. The dynamics of the global LNG market continue
to play a crucial role in amplifying price volatility, particularly
during the winter months. In the Low scenario, a more accelerated energy
transition and diminished global gas demand are projected to maintain
prices around 30 €/MWh in 2024, with levels dipping at 20 €/MWh in 2025
and below 20 €/MWh by 2026. Conversely, the High scenario anticipates
that economic stagnation, reduced investment, and geopolitical
instability will push prices above 50 €/MWh by 2025. PSV is expected to
align with the mid-term normalization of European gas prices towards 30
€/MWh by 2030, in the Reference scenario, reflecting a gradual
re-balancing of global gas demand-supply dynamics amid the anticipated
acceleration of the energy transition. In the very long-term PSV price
should converge to an equilibrium of 25 €/MWh in the Reference scenario
and 10 €/MWh in the Low case, while it should settle above 40 €/MWh in
the High scenario.

The formalization of the ETS system reform underscores its essential
role in advancing the decarbonization process. This introduction of new
measures comes in the context of weakened macroeconomic fundamentals, a
prolonged period of low demand, and a bearish trend in CO2 prices since
the second quarter of 2023. Several factors are estimated to have
contributed to this decline in demand, including reduced industrial
production—particularly in energy-intensive sectors—higher energy costs
from the previous year prompting increased savings, elevated inflation
rates, and a restrictive monetary policy adversely affecting economic
growth. In our Reference scenario, the average CO2 price for 2024 is
projected to approach 67 €/ton, propelled by the gradual implementation
of the ETS reform. The planned phase-out of free allowances for the
aviation sector—accounting for 50% of total allowances by 2025—and the
scheduled removal of 90 million permits from the market in 2024 are
expected to drive allowance prices upward as supply diminishes.
Furthermore, the gradual inclusion of the maritime transport sector
starting in 2025 is anticipated to further elevate overall demand, with
prices projected to reach 107 €/ton by 2030. Key concerns center around
the limited demand recovery expected in the next few years due to
sluggish economic growth. The Low case scenario envisions a rapid
economic recovery alongside challenges in decarbonizing hard-to-abate
sectors such as aviation and maritime transport. These dynamics could
lead to a substantial increase in demand, pushing the CO2 price to
exceed 130 €/ton before 2030. Conversely, if further demand disruptions
occur due to high energy costs, reduced industrial output, and delays in
implementing new regulations, the High case scenario may emerge, wherein
ETS prices fail to rebound, remaining below 65 €/ton in the short term
and under 75 €/ton until 2030. The effectiveness of the ETS system is
crucial for achieving long-term emission reduction targets, with the CO2
price projected to exceed 120 €/ton in the Reference scenario by 2040,
potentially rising to just under 150 €/ton in the Low scenario or
nearing 90 €/ton in the High scenario.

In 2023, electricity consumption fell to 306 TWh, marking a 3% decline
from 2022. However, a modest recovery in the macroeconomic outlook for
2024, coupled with increased electrification of end-use consumption, is
projected to raise consumption to 312 TWh in the Reference scenario. In
a more optimistic economic context, consumption could reach 315 TWh, as
indicated in the Low case scenario. Conversely, a more pessimistic
outlook, along with delays in the electrification of final uses, is
anticipated to result in a consumption level of 310 TWh in the High
scenario. In the coming years, supportive economic measures driven by
the NRRP and the realization of electrification potential could create a
divergence in forecasts, with consumption potentially ranging from 327
TWh in the High scenario to 358 TWh in the Low case by 2030. The
Reference case anticipates a more contained efficiency trajectory and
moderate economic growth, projecting electricity demand to reach 339 TWh
by 2030. In the long term, a successful electrification trajectory
combined with a stable economic outlook could drive consumption to 377
TWh by 2040 in the Low scenario. The Reference scenario anticipates a
more moderate increase, projecting consumption at 364 TWh. Conversely,
the structural delays reflected in the High scenario are expected to
result in electricity demand of only 340 TWh. The overall contraction of
electricity demand in European countries, coupled with a recovery in
hydro generation following the severe drought of 2022 and the first half
of 2023, alongside the resurgence of nuclear availability in France, has
contributed to a 15% year-on-year increase in net import flows in 2023,
reaching 53 TWh. During the first nine months of 2024, imports accounted
for 16% of demand in that period, consistent with the same quota from
2023. In the coming years, persistently subdued electricity demand,
combined with the growing installed capacity and generation of renewable
energy sources (RES) across Europe, is expected to sustain steady
imports to Italy, particularly from northern borders. The commissioning
of the new Passio Resia interconnector, linking Austria and Italy with a
capacity of 300 MW, will further enhance inflows from Austria. High
electricity imports to Italy are also bolstered by the PUN, which
remains stable well above other European electricity prices, especially
those in France and Switzerland. Notably, the average spread between the
Italian power price and those of neighboring countries has nearly
doubled over the past five years. As we approach 2030, the consolidation
of these dynamics—coupled with the expansion of RES capacity to meet
projected increases in power demand—supports expectations of
overgeneration across Europe, despite the gradual phase-out of
coal-fired generation on the continent. This trend indicates that
imports will continue to be a cost-effective option in the medium to
long term, reinforcing projections of imports around 45 TWh even beyond
2030.

The grid expansion aligns with Terna’s 2023 Development Plan. In the
Reference scenario, reinforcements are projected to be operational by
the 2020s, with significant improvements to address zonal congestion
expected to be completed in the 2030s, including the Tyrrhenian and
Adriatic links, as well as the initial segments of the Hypergrid. In the
Low scenario, a more rapid adoption of renewable energy would
necessitate the implementation of these major projects even before 2030.
Conversely, the slower transition seen in the High scenario would delay
key investments until the mid-2030s.

By 2030, the Southern zone and the Islands are projected to experience
significant risks of overgeneration and curtailment, underscoring the
urgent need for a substantial increase in new electrochemical storage
projects. The trajectory of storage capacity expansion is closely tied
to the current eligible pipeline, the growth of renewable energy
sources, and grid enhancement plans. While the anticipated expansion of
RES capacity in the Reference scenario falls short of the targets
established by the PNIEC, storage capacity projections are similarly
expected to underperform, reaching approximately 15 GW by 2030. However,
these dynamics may accelerate or decelerate significantly, heavily
influenced by the evolution of RES permitting and deployment trends. In
the Low scenario, we anticipate storage capacity could reach 20 GW,
reflecting a more rapid growth in RES capacity. Long-term development of
battery storage should capitalize on time-shifting applications within
the day-ahead market. Investments in power-intensive electrochemical
batteries could prove financially viable in the medium term, primarily
generating revenue through participation in the balancing phase of the
Ancillary Services Market and long-term capacity remuneration via
specific projects. Investment in merchant energy-intensive storage
batteries is expected to be attractive mainly in the long term, when
time-shifting applications in the day-ahead market become economically
sustainable due to increasing price volatility and instances of
overgeneration. By 2040, our Reference scenario anticipates the
development of up to 29 GW of energy-intensive batteries, with 35 GW
projected in the Low scenario. The regulatory framework is undergoing
significant changes, creating new opportunities for battery storage. The
MACSE mechanism, designed for storage stand alone, offers a regulated
remuneration model in which Terna pays a fixed fee (€/MWh/year) for
capacity provision and allocates 20% of the revenues from balancing
activities to support the storage development. In October, the MASE
approved the rules that regulate this new mechanism. The auctions are
expected to be scheduled in the first half of 2025, with at least six
months before the definition of the auction perimeters and the updating
of economic parameters.

The need to boost energy independence in the decarbonization process at
European level has placed green hydrogen at the forefront of the
European energy strategy (REPowerEU). It is expected to determine the
allocation of substantial funding – way more than the amount currently
earmarked – to accelerate the development of a European hydrogen supply
chain, improving current cost perspectives of green solutions. But
accelerating renewables development poses the risk of structural
overgeneration if the development of BESS does not advance concurrently,
especially in less interconnected regions and have a high intensity of
renewables relative to demand, such as Sardinia and Sicily where
economically viable opportunities for competitive green hydrogen
consolidate starting from 2035.

In 2023, electricity prices experienced a significant decline of 58%
from their peak in 2022, averaging €127/MWh. This downward trend closely
mirrors developments in the gas market, underscoring the dependency of
electricity prices on gas dynamics. The easing of short-term gas market
conditions, coupled with an increase in renewable electricity
production, has exerted consistent downward pressure on power prices
throughout Europe since the year's outset. This trend is anticipated to
persist into 2024, driven by improved conditions in the Italian gas
market and further growth in renewable generation. In this context, the
average PUN is expected to approach €107 €/MWh under the Reference
scenario and €100/MWh in the Low case. However, for 2025 and 2026, we
foresee a potential increase in PUN projections, averaging near
€110/MWh. This anticipated rise can be attributed to two primary
factors: firstly, a recovery in CO2 prices expected in 2025, bolstered
by reforms to the EU ETS; and secondly, the variable logistic costs are
projected to remain around €4/MWh in the short term, as the CRVOS
component—which incentivizes storage injections—remains crucial for
adequate cost coverage (ARERA Resolution 182/2024). This situation may
be further complicated by renewed tensions in the global gas market,
contingent on potential delays in LNG liquefaction capacity development.
Overall, while robust renewable production driven by hydroelectric and
solar energy, high import levels, and moderate consumption continue to
mitigate demand pressures on CCGT gas power plants, the uncertainty
surrounding future logistic costs and inherent risks in the gas market
necessitate a slight upward revision of electricity price projections.
In the Low scenario, a decline in demand and a swift transition toward
renewable technologies are projected to lower prices to €96/MWh. As we
approach 2030, the integration of renewable energy sources into the
energy mix, coupled with further reductions in commodity prices and
gradual improvements in grid infrastructure, is expected to bring prices
down to €73/MWh in the Low case. Conversely, in the Reference scenario,
a partial delay in the decarbonization trajectory and elevated PSV
prices will result in an average price of €105/MWh. In the medium term,
the increasing penetration of renewables, particularly solar energy, is
anticipated to significantly influence peak and off-peak pricing
dynamics post-2030, leading to an inversion of price spreads between
time slots. With a projected slow recovery in electricity demand,
disparities in zonal prices are expected to be limited due to reduced
transit between market zones. Furthermore, substantial electricity
imports from the northern borders will help alleviate congestion.
Average zonal spreads are expected to remain below €1/MWh in the short
term, with the exception of the South and Calabria, which may experience
a gap of €2/MWh. However, beyond 2026, zonal spreads are anticipated to
widen, potentially peaking around €10/MWh in the 2030s, driven by
increasing electricity consumption alongside accelerated renewable
energy development. Over the long term, significant growth in renewable
energy sources within the Southern macro-zone is expected to exert
downward pressure on prices due to the cannibalization effect of solar
technologies. Despite ongoing grid enhancements, bottlenecks between the
northern and southern zones are likely to persist, resulting in
differentiated price levels throughout the 2030s. From 2036 onward,
further grid reinforcements are projected to mitigate inter-zonal
congestion on the mainland; however, critical congestion issues are
expected to remain in the islands.

The Law 11/2024, known as DL Energia, mandates that starting from
January 1st, 2025 final customers will transition to paying zonal prices
based on wholesale market price trends, departing from PUN. The reform
is driven by the necessity to implement Capacity Allocation & Congestion
Management (CACM) rules, which aim to establish a unified European
market by simplifying algorithms, and to create locational signals for
both demand and supply. Many aspects still require clarification,
particularly the methodologies for implementation, which will play a
crucial role in defining the market impact of the reform.

In the recent past, prices for renewable technologies have closely
followed the fluctuations in commodities markets, benefiting from
bullish trends. However, in 2023, prices began to gradually decline,
resulting in an alignment of zonal pricing that reflects the varying
impacts of different energy mixes. Notably, the reduction in coal
generation in Southern zones has led to lower prices compared to those
in the Northern zones. In the short term, price differentials are
expected to remain consistent with last year's outcomes, demonstrating a
general alignment across zones. Looking ahead to 2030, the continued
integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into the energy mix is
projected to exacerbate this disparity, leading to increased price
differentials, particularly in the Southern zones.

In the coming years, a contraction in electricity demand, coupled with
an increase in imports, is expected to impact the competitiveness of gas
plants, diminishing their marginality compared to the peaks observed in
recent years, which were driven by high commodity prices. The captured
CSS for the average CCGT operating at 53% efficiency is projected to
align with 2023 results, approximately €10/MWh, while baseload CSS is
anticipated to average around -€1.2/MWh in 2024 and -€2.5/MWh in 2025.
Post-2025, despite the entry of new thermal capacity through the
Capacity Market, marginality is expected to stabilize at around
€15-€18/MWh due to the retirement of older power plants, the complete
phase-out of coal by 2029, and the ongoing necessity for gas plants to
ensure system adequacy. In the Reference scenario, gas-fired generation
is projected to remain a backbone of the national energy mix even as
renewables ascend to become the primary source of production over the
coming decades, with renewables expected to dominate only after 2031.
The thermoelectric share in the generation mix is likely to decrease
gradually but will remain close to 30% of national electricity needs
until 2040. The evolving market conditions, influenced by geopolitical
tensions and other factors observed over the past two years, along with
changes in market design and regulatory frameworks such as the XBID
initiative and Terna’s Incentive scheme, are reshaping the market
landscape and are expected to permanently alter the revenue structures
for gas-fired power plants. As seen in recent years, the operational
focus for CCGTs is expected to be heavily concentrated—over 80% of total
production—on the Day-Ahead Market, particularly during the ex-ante
phase, which has contracted significantly by 85% compared to 2021
ex-ante volumes. Operational activity has shifted toward the balancing
phase, which remains stable despite Terna’s interventions. As renewable
energy sources increasingly contribute to generation, the Balancing
Market may provide additional support for the marginality of thermal
units. The implementation of TIDE in 2025 may bolster market revenues
for CCGTs by introducing new service remuneration, currently mandatory
under “Riserva Primaria,” and potentially relaxing operational
constraints depending on XBID participation. The evolution of market
regulation and the structure of the generation mix may favor thermal
units within the ASM, thereby supporting their revenues. Furthermore,
the growing need for balancing services arising from the integration of
RES is expected to enhance operational opportunities in the ASM,
particularly in southern regions, where the development of flexible
capacity lags behind demand.

The scenario analysis is complemented by an assessment of the economic
viability of the current thermal generation fleet given the expected
market scenario. This evaluation aims to highlight potential financial
viability challenges that may arise, emphasizing the need to consider
extending a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism solely for existing capacity
or substituting unfinished projects. As noted by Terna in its latest
adequacy report, system adequacy has been at risk over the past three
years, despite the operational capacity market, particularly during
extreme weather conditions such as those experienced in the summer of
2022. The significant reduction in hydroelectric production, combined
with increased unavailability of water-cooled thermal power plants and
limited imported energy due to French nuclear unavailability, has
exacerbated these challenges. The proposed changes are intended for
auctions related to the years 2025-2027, scheduled for the summer of
2024. With the recent DCO 102/2024 published by ARERA, the new capacity
market premium cap should be set higher than in previous auctions to
account for the revised inflation index by the ECB.

The new long-term scenario analysis conducted by MBS reflects the latest
trends in the evolution of the Italian energy system. It aligns with the
Fit-for-55 targets for 2030 and explores potential pathways toward 2050.
Market simulations are extended beyond 2040, employing deterministic
techniques to explicitly model market fundamentals, while incorporating
the recent acceleration in the permitting and deployment of renewable
technologies. All analyses are based on the current market structure and
established rules. The projected trajectory falls short of the Net Zero
targets: by 2050, it is anticipated that only 86% of Italy's electricity
demand will be met by renewable generation, with the remaining demand
supplied by flexible and efficient gas generation, which remains
essential for system adequacy. The further contraction of operating
hours, particularly during morning and evening peaks, underscores the
necessity for an explicit remuneration mechanism to ensure the economic
viability of these gas plants. As renewables are expected to emerge as
the predominant marginal technology, market prices are projected to
become increasingly independent of gas generation costs and more closely
aligned with the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of renewable
technologies, particularly as their marginal share reaches 40% of annual
operating hours. To assess price dynamics beyond 2050, specifically
within the 2050-2060 horizon, we assume an extension of 2030 results
while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty associated with available
data for a thorough long-term evaluation. Scenarios for 2040-2060 will
be meticulously analyzed in future updates to facilitate a comprehensive
discussion on the economic sustainability of policy frameworks aimed at
achieving net zero targets.

# Macroeconomic Context

## GDP

::: callout-main
**GDP GROWTH IN THE SHORT TERM REMAINS SUBDUED, WITH A MODERATE RECOVERY
IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ANTICIPATED, SUPPORTED BY WAGE DYNAMICS AND THE
EASING OF MONETARY POLICIES. IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM, GROWTH
PROSPECTS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE PATH OF DISINFLATION, EASING
FINANCING CONDITIONS, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NRRP**
:::

![](figs/10_Italian_GDP_Growth_Rate.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The reference scenario predicts a 0.4% year-on-year GDP growth in 2024,
with a stronger increase of 1% in 2025, driven by an anticipated easing
of financial conditions. A gradual easing of monetary policies in the
second half of the year, along with positive wage dynamics, should
contribute to growth in 2025. In the worst-case scenario, if
inflationary pressures persist, GDP is projected to decline by 0.1%
year-on-year in 2024 and see a modest increase of 0.3% in 2025.
Conversely, the best-case scenario, characterized by accelerated
disinflation and a recovery in investments, would result in GDP growth
of up to 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference and Best scenarios, economic growth would gradually
realign to the previously projected path, sustained by the effective
implementation of the NRRP measures, the recovery of the global economy,
and an acceleration of the green transition reforms.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In the long-term, our Reference and Best-case scenarios remain anchored
to the assumption of a stabilization of the yearly GDP growth rate in
the 1-2% interval, while in the Worst scenario, GDP growth continues to
discount the effects of the failure of key investments.
:::
:::

::: callout-wrap

#### Main updates {.unnumbered}
:::

Short-term GDP projections were revised upward, as a faster than
expected disinflation and the probable easing of monetary policies
combined with positive wage dynamics contribute to GDP growth.

## Inflation rate

::: callout-main
**THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ENERGY PRICES NORMALIZATION IS DRIVING THE
GENERAL PRICE INDEX DECLINE, WITH ITS REDUCTION BEGINNING TO TRANSMIT
ALSO TO THE CORE INDEX. MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING PROVED TO BE
EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES AND KEEPING MEDIUM AND LONG
TERM EXPECTATIONS UNDER CONTROL**
:::

![](figs/11_Inflation_rate.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Inflation is expected to remain close to 2% both in 2024 and 2025, with
the ongoing disinflation path expected to gradually ease as the
carry-over effect of declining energy prices diminish and the monetary
policy stance reverts. Since mid-2024, the European Central Bank and the
Federal Reserve have indeed approved the first cuts to reference rates
to support investments, following the reduction in inflation risk. The
path to monetary normalization remains uncertain, though, as the
decisions of the two Central Banks are highly dependent on economic
outcomes. Geopolitical uncertainty could further weigh on the inflation
outlook, as new disruptions in the production and transportation chains
of imported goods may increase pressure on inflation.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Still relatively high interest rates are seen as proving effective in
guiding inflation back to 2% in the short term. Our scenario foresees a
stabilization at 2% in the second part of the decade, even with a
gradual easing of monetary policy, although the risk of further pressure
on prices due to the expected easing of monetary policy.

### LNG

::: callout-main
**GLOBAL LNG DEMAND IS SEEN AS GROWING STEADY IN THE SHORT TERM, WITH A
NOTABLE DISPARITY IN GROWTH RATE SHOWCASED BETWEEN THE ASIAN AND
EUROPEAN BLOCS. DELAYS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIQUEFACTION AND
REGASIFICATION CAPACITY, INDUCED BY LOW PRICES, COULD TRANSLATE IN
RENEWED DEMAND-SUPPLY TENSIONS IN 2025-2026. THERE IS A HIGH PROPABILITY
OF AN OVERSUPPLED MARKET POST-2026 LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR LNG PRICES
NORMALIZING IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM**
:::

![](figs/12_World_LNG_Demand.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Global LNG demand growth is forecasted to grow with an average growth
rate close to 5% in 2024, with a possible acceleration in 2025 led by
regasification capacity in full swing worldwide. European and Chinese
gas demand will primarily drive this uprise, as LNG intake is expected
to accelerate in the short-term, in response to expansion of
regasification capacity, and to support the transition from coal.
Despite 2024 LNG supply growth being limited globally, reduced
competition between Europe and Asia, and the expected new capacity
entering the market in 2025, are likely to guarantee adequate demand
coverage. Should new liquefaction plants construction and FIDs suffer
further delays, renewed tensions could emerge in winter 2025-2026
leading to price upswings.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Starting from 2026, LNG demand growth is expected to gradually slowdown,
stabilizing just below 5% y/y, consistently with rising renewable energy
production and improved energy efficiency measures. Conditional on the
lack of further delays, a new wave of liquefaction capacity will enter
the market by 2026, driven by US and Qatar, contributing to almost
eliminating the risk of market tightness.

### TTF Price

::: callout-main
**THE PROBABILITY OF DEMAND RETURNING TO PRE-CRISIS LEVELS IN THE NEXT
THREE YEARS IS CONSIDERED LOW, AS THE SAVINGS MEASURES ADOPTED IN
RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN GAS DISRUPTION HAVE LED TO STRUCTURAL SHIFTS. IN
THE LONGER TERM, WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL DEMAND DECLINES DUE TO EUROPE'S
DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS, RESULTING IN A LOWER TTF PRICE TREND
APPROACHING €25/MWH. THAT SAID, PRICE PRESSURES AND VOLATILITY SURGES,
PARTICULARLY DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MAY STILL ARISE IN THE COMING
YEARS**
:::

![](figs/12_TTF_Price.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference scenario, the TTF yearly average for 2024 and 2025 is
projected to remain below €40/MWh, with subdued demand putting downward
pressure on prices. Europe's LNG import capacity is poised to expand by
a further 30 Bcm in 2024, enabling additional LNG arrivals, which will
be crucial for maintaining market equilibrium in the short-term and
structurally adapting to the absence of Russian piped gas supplies.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
From 2026 onwards, a further normalization is anticipated as a result of
the significant deployment of new liquefaction capacity. Assuming a
progressive growth of global LNG supplies alongside an acceleration of
the energy transition, European gas prices are projected to steadily
decrease towards 30 €/MWh by 2028.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-40 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The European decarbonization process would keep reducing gas demand,
successively pressuring the price action back towards the 25 €/MWh
long-term equilibrium. Only in the High scenario, persisting
geopolitical and commercial tensions would leave commodities shortages
unresolved, leaving prices just below 45 €/MWh in the long-term.
Effective green policies supported by economic growth may lead prices
significantly lower in the Low scenario, with the TTF averaging near 10
€/MWh in the long-term.

### Spread TTF-PSV

::: callout-main
**IN THE SHORT-TO-MEDIUM TERM THE PSV GAS PRICE IS ANTICIPATED TO
MAINTAIN A PREMIUM COMPARED TO THE TTF, FOLLOWING THE NEED FOR NORTHERN
EUROPE GAS FLOWS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INTERRUPTION OF RUSSIAN PIPED GAS
SUPPLIES. THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE OLT LNG REGASIFICATION FACILITY
IN ITALY UNTIL THE END OF NOVEMBER 2024 ADDS PRESSURE IN THE VERY
NEAR-TERM. IN THE LONG-TERM, THE REBALANCING OF FLOWS IS SEEN AS LEADING
TO A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE SPREAD TOWARDS ZERO**
:::

![](figs/14_Spread_TTF_PSV.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The PSV-TTF spread is expected to stay just below 3 €/MWh in 2024
following the closure of the OLT LNG regasification facility which
increases the Italy’s reliance on piped gas flows from Norway via *Passo
Gries*. Fluctuations throughout the year are anticipated to be in line
with seasonality.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Flows from the TAP and Algeria, and LNG arrivals are seen as partially
taking over imports from the North in the medium-term, leading to a
progressive spread closure to below 1 €/MWh by 2030.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}

The PSV-TTF spread is foreseen to reabsorb towards zero in the

and LNG expected to combine with the underlying decarbonization-induced
demand reduction.
:::
:::

::: callout-wrap
::: callout-left
#### Main updates {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
PSV-TTF spread is still expected to remain positive in short and medium
term and to reduce progressively towards null in the long-run. A slight
increase in the short-term average PSV-TTF spread follows OLT LNG
regasification facility temporary halt, coherently with our
expectations.
:::

\newpage

### PSV Price

::: callout-main
**THE ITALIAN GAS PRICE CONTINUES TO BE CLOSELY TIED TO THE EUROPEAN HUB
ONE, WITH THE TTF SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING PSV TRENDS. HOWEVER, THE
TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OLT LNG FACILITY LEADS TO SHORT-TERM PROJECTIONS
SUGGESTING WIDER DEVIATIONS FROM THE TTF. IN THE LONG RUN, WE FORESEE
THE PSV TO ALIGN WITH THE EUROPEAN PRICES, TARGETING 30 €/MWH BY 2030**
:::

![](figs/15_PSV_Price.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
We expect the 2024 PSV yearly average to remain below €40/MWh due to
limited recovery in gas demand. The transition towards savings and
efficiency impacts distribution network consumption, while slow growth
in the energy-intensive sector restricts industrial demand, contributing
to below-average thermoelectric gas consumption. Additionally, delays in
the commissioning of the Ravenna FSRU have hindered expectations for gas
demand recovery. Should tensions surrounding LNG and TTF prices reemerge
in winter 2025-2026, the PSV is likely to respond accordingly.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The PSV is foreseen to follow the European gas prices mid-term
normalization towards 30 €/MWh by year 2030, as a gradual rebalancing of
the global gas demand-supply dynamics should follow the expected
acceleration of energy transition.

Our short-term expectations for the European gas hubs prices remain
consistent with our prior market update on the back of the persisting

### Logistics Costs for Italian Gas-Fired Units

::: callout-main
**GAS LOGISTIC COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH IN THE SHORT-TERM DUE
TO THE INCREASE RELATED TO THE COVERAGE OF STORAGE INJECTIONS ACTIVITY
 IN PARTICULAR. VARIABLE LOGISTIC GAS COSTS SHOULD START GRADUALLY
DECREASING FROM 2028 ONWARDS, FOLLOWING THE EXPECTED GAS PRICES
NORMALIZATION**
:::

![](figs/16_Italian_Gas_Fired_units.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-27 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The 2023 logistic cost for Italian gas-fired units averaged 4 €/MWh amid
the increase of the CRVOS (which pays storage injections incentives),
CRVBL (which covers the charges associated with the gas system balancing
activity) and the CVU (which covers variable charges and it’s linked to
the gas price trend) components. The variable logistic cost remains
around 4 €/MWh short-term due to the essential CRVOS component for
storage injection incentives, though thermoelectric producers could
request over 60% exemption from October 2024 (ARERA Resolution
384/2024). The remaining losses stemmed from extra cost derived from
2022 emergency gas purchases to rebuild storages (nearly 5 Bln€) will be
recovered through final customers’ bills over five years. The ARERA
Resolution 263/2024 temporary fixes the CRVBL component (which covers
the charges associated with the gas system balancing activity) equal to

In our Reference scenario, the 2024 CO2 price average is projected to
stay near 70 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the ETS
system reform. The phasing out of free allowances for the aviation
sector, reaching 50% of the total in 2025, along with the planned
removal of 90 Mln permits from the market in 2024, are expected to begin
exerting upward pressure on allowances prices by curtailing supply. From
2025 onwards, the progressive inclusion of the maritime transport sector
will further boost overall demand. Concerns remain regarding the
underlying demand recovery, which is anticipated to be limited over the
next couple of years due to a slow economic growth.

The widening of the supply-demand gap should become evident starting
from 2026, as the maritime sector integrates into the ETS system and the
phasing out of free allowances for aviation reaches full implementation.
In addition, by 2030, the reinforcement of the Market Stability Reserve
and the increase of the Linear Reduction Factor up to 4.4% will
contribute to further tightening the market. As a result, the CO2 price
is expected to accelerate towards 110 €/ton on average by 2030.

By 2034 the removal of free allowances for sectors covered by the CBAM
will reach full implementation, inducing a further increase in
allowances demand. The long-term targets would hinge upon the effective
efficiency of the ETS System, with the CO2 price expected to exceed 120
€/ton in the Reference scenario by 2040, and potentially accelerate to
just below 150 €/ton in the Low scenario, under the assumption of
stricter decarbonization efforts in Europe to accelerate the prices
increase.

The reduction in electricity demand across Europe, combined with
supply-side overgeneration driven by the recovery of nuclear plant
capacity after two years of maintenance and an increase in hydroelectric
production, has led to a rise in electricity imports from the northern
borders. This phenomenon is expected to continue in the short term.
Additionally, the positive trend in the installation of new renewable
energy sources (RES) observed in 2023 and the first half of 2024 is
anticipated to persist, with gas-fired thermal plants maintaining their

A rapid surge in decarbonization efforts is driven by rising commodity

new renewable projects, all of which collectively boost investment in
energy efficiency. The phase-out of coal-fired units across the

By the end of 2028 coal-fired units are entirely phased-out. Falling

capacity expands. However, despite progress in storage and grid
enhancements, achieving full renewable integration will encounter
challenges like grid congestion and overproduction. These issues are

A modest economic recovery is anticipated over the next two years,
resulting in an increase in electricity demand, projected to reach
nearly 316 TWh by 2025 (+1.1% year-on-year). Positive growth is also
expected in alternative scenarios: in the high case scenario, demand is
estimated at 312 TWh, reflecting a lower rate of economic recovery,

from EVs, respectively. In the Low scenario, a more rapid adoption of
electric vehicles is expected to reach 6 million by 2030 and 15 million
by 2040. Conversely, in the High scenario, the development of e-mobility
experiences a 5- to 10-year delay compared to the Reference scenario,
with the target of 4.5 million EVs only being achieved by 2040.

The NIECP envisages 6.5 million electric vehicles in Italy in 2030 - 4.3
million are pure EVs (BEV: Battery Electric Vehicles) -- accounting for
about 8 TWh of additional electricity demand. In our Reference view we
estimate additional 7.5 TWh to come from BEV and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid

The existing fleet of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) is projected
to average approximately 2200 EOH during the 2024-2025 period,
exhibiting significant zonal variations. In the Northern zone, the load
factor for CCGTs is around 1800 EOH, while the Southern zones show lower
figures, averaging about 1000 EOH. Notably, Calabria stands out with an
average of 3000 EOH.

After the phase-out of coal-fired units, residual demand is expected to
rebound. However, existing combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) will face
significant competition from sustained import levels and new
high-efficiency entrants supported by the capacity market. In the low
scenario, residual demand is further reduced due to the effects of
energy efficiency improvements and increased renewable penetration.
Conversely, in the high scenario, residual demand gradually increases as
switching conditions improve.
:::

Existing CCGTs (53%-efficiency) stabilize around 2000 EOH. In the Low
scenario, the great renewable penetration influences competitive
dynamics and existing units remain close to 1600 EOH. In the High
scenario, the improvement of switching conditions is hampered by the
high level of imports from abroad, with EOH of existing units over 2000
favored by phase-out after 2035. High-efficiency units stabilize below
the 4800 EOH only in the Low scenario.

By the end of the year, 36 GW of solar and 13 GW of wind capacity are
expected to be operational. The potential for renewable energy
development is assessed based on recent trends, considering both
bureaucratic and technical obstacles. This analysis projects an increase
of 6.5 GW in solar capacity and 1.7 GW in wind capacity between the end
of 2024 and 2027. These estimates are aligned with the installation
growth trends observed in recent years, driven by the joint impact of
the normative simplification of the permitting process brought about by

:::

::: callout-right
Under BAU market conditions and moderate renewable penetration, the risk
of overgeneration remains limited in both the Reference and High cases.
However, a more pronounced increase in capacity installation in the
South macro-zone could result in higher instances of overgeneration
during certain hours in the Low case scenario.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The increased penetration of renewable energy sources expected after
2027 is likely to raise the risk of overgeneration, potentially leading
to around 2 TWh of excess electricity in the Low scenario by 2030. The
curtailment effect may become more pronounced under specific local grid
conditions. In contrast, the Reference scenario anticipates a more
moderate level of overgeneration, approaching 0.5 TWh by 2030. Overall,
during this decade, overgeneration is expected to intensify due to the
rapid expansion of renewable energy in the Southern regions of the
country, and it could be exacerbated if coupled with insufficient grid
reinforcement.
:::
:::

To effectively manage the increasing penetration of renewable energy and
the resulting overgeneration, substantial investments in grid
reinforcement and high-capacity energy storage solutions will be
essential throughout the 2030s. These measures will be critical for
balancing the grid and maintaining a stable energy supply, particularly
in regions more susceptible to overgeneration. Additionally, this excess
energy production presents an opportunity to expand electrolysis
capacity, which would not only harness surplus energy but also support
continued investments in renewable energy sources.

In the long term, the expansion of renewable capacity—particularly in
the Southern regions—is expected to significantly increase the incidence
of systematic overgeneration, especially on the islands. Grid
investments and battery energy storage systems (BESS) will likely prove
inadequate to address this issue, thereby creating favorable conditions
for the adoption of green hydrogen technologies. In the Reference
scenario, installed electrolysis capacity could reach nearly 0.5 GW,
predominantly concentrated in Sardinia. Over time, electrolysis capacity
can effectively mitigate overgeneration by offering a mechanism to store
surplus renewable energy. Moreover, by enhancing demand during periods
of high renewable energy source (RES) production, it can help stabilize
prices and alleviate the cannibalization effect, particularly during the
later stages of the transition.

-2.5 €/MWh is projected for thermal plants in the Reference scenario for
2025.

In the second half of the 2020s, existing CCGTs are poised to benefit
from the phase-out of coal-fired units. Coupled with a recovery in
electricity demand, this is anticipated to enhance baseload CSS, which
is expected to reach approximately 2.9 €/MWh. Nevertheless, this benefit
could be countered by heightened competition from newly constructed

Network congestion is generally not a significant problem on the
mainland. With electricity demand remaining below historical levels and
renewable generation increasing gradually, prices in the Southern
regions are lower. In contrast, increased CCGT operations in the
Northern zones contribute to prices exceeding the PUN, in line with
recent historical trends.
:::
:::

::: callout-item

Surging renewable penetration is projected to exacerbate inter-zonal
congestion through 2030; while major grid enhancements, such as the
completion of the Adriatic Link, will improve energy exchanges from
South to North, they will only partially mitigate congestion in the
medium term. Continued expansion of renewable capacity in the Southern
zones is likely to increase the frequency of congestion events,
upsurging the incidence of price spreads over time.

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The spread between the PUN and the Southern market zones is expected to
remain at recent historical levels in the short term, with the Southern
zone experiencing a discount. This dynamic is driven by a general
decrease in electricity demand and an increasing share of renewable
energy sources (RES) in the generation mix, leading to lower prices
compared to the Northern zones. Despite the rise in import flows, CCGTs
in the North are still needed to meet demand, resulting in average
prices that are higher.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

In both the Reference and Low cases, the incorporation of renewable
technologies results in a wider spread, despite network interventions.
Conversely, in the High scenario, the spread decreases due to more
restrained growth in renewables, allowing for gradual enhancements in
the operational conditions of gas-fired units until 2030, when coal
generation becomes less competitive compared to gas.
:::

In the Reference case, the significant penetration of renewables in
Southern regions increases the spread during the first half of the
2030s, signaling the market for new electrochemical battery energy
storage systems (BESS) to enter and prompting new grid investments. In
the Low scenario, the expected and accelerated development of storage
and network investments contributes to a reduction in the spread.
However, ongoing growth in renewable energy sources causes the spread to

The anticipated energy outlook, marked by stagnating electricity demand,
an increasing share of renewable energy sources (RES), and higher levels

:::
:::

::: callout-item

Market competition is expected to increase due to the stabliziation of
import flows from Northern borders, the rise in renewable capacity, and
the entry of new high-efficiency CCGTs, acquired through Capacity Market
auctions. These dynamics are expected to keep baseload CSS in negative
territory. In the Low scenario, characterized by accellerated renewable
development and heightened competition within the thermoelectric sector,
this pressure will be even more pronounced, with CSS projected to
average around -3 €/MWh.
:::
:::

Post-2030, the decommissioning of aging capacity will enable existing
CCGTs (53%-efficiency) to remain the marginal technology for at least
85% of the operating hours through 2040. During this horizon, baseload
CSS is expected to remain below -2 €/MWh. In the Low scenario,
characterized by greater renewable penetration, baseload CSS is
projected to fall further, staying below -7 €/MWh in the long-term
(post-2040). Conversely, in the High scenario, where renewable
development is more limited, increased CCGT generation will result in
higher baseload CSS, though it is still expected to remain below -4

As renewable capacity increases, existing units tend to concentrate
their operations during evening hours to maximize captured margins. The

Solar power plants stand to benefit from projected moderate increases in
power prices, with captured prices varying between approximately 98€/MWh

88€/MWh and 92€/MWh.
:::
:::

::: callout-item

### Investment costs and IRR of Solar and Wind

**INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE PV MODULES MARKET DRIVES DOWN INVESTMENT

#### Solar {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The high competition in the PV modules market, predominantly led by
Chinese manufacturers, has driven the costs of PV modules down to around
€150,000 per MW. Nearly 30% of the total cost for a module is attributed
to polysilicon, a relatively inexpensive but highly volatile material.
Other critical materials with high demand and low availability, such as
silver, could potentially increase the price of the technology in the
future. Generally, due to market competitiveness, PV modules account for
only 15% of the total solar CAPEX. Two significant costs impact the
total CAPEX for solar technologies. The cost of connecting to the grid,
which varies greatly by project, is expected to rise in the coming
years. This is due to the increasing number of projects in remote
locations, complicating high-voltage grid connections. Additionally, the
cost of land acquisition or rental, which constitutes nearly 8% of the
total cost, has increased in recent years. The anticipated acceleration
of new installations in the coming years may further drive up land
demand for solar projects, as available sites diminish, thereby
increasing rental costs. This cost structure typically results in an IRR
of around 7% (base case considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices,
30 years time horizon) for solar projects, with regional variations
according to different zonal captured prices. For agri-voltaic projects,
a markup of 20%-40% on the total investment cost must be applied,
leading to a lower expected IRR of around 6%.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### Wind {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The primary cost for a wind plant is the turbine and inverter, which
account for 60% of the total cost. Grid connection represents 10% of the
wind CAPEX, which is approximately €1.5 million for an onshore wind
project. In the short and mid-term, technology costs are unlikely to
decrease due to the low rate of new installations, which limits the
potential for economies of scale. However, as the technology matures,
particularly in Northern countries where installation rates are higher,
there may be a reduction in technology costs. Despite this, the CAPEX
for a wind project is expected to remain above €1 million until 2040.
This cost structure typically results in an IRR of around 7% (base case
considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices, 20 years time horizon)
for onshore wind projects.

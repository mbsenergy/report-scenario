# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2025-2050 (with projections up to
2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of
proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural
models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of
regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our
elaborations.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and
economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and
fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the
pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of
the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables
in line with the historical average trend.

In this perspective, we defined three scenarios:

-   The **Low RES scenario** is characterized by permanently high fuels
    and power prices amid negative or zero economic growth depressing
    investments and weighing on the energy transition process.\

-   In the **Reference scenario**, is characterized by the energy
    transition process progress leading to a diversification of energy
    sources supported by the existing policies. This, combined with
    efficiency maintains the energy market on a transformation path. The
    economic growth slowly recovers over the next two years.

-   The **High RES scenario** would materialize in the event of
    favorable weather conditions and a fast energy transition, supported
    by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing power and
    fossil fuels demand over the next few years. This would limit energy
    prices upside potential and then fuel a downward acceleration.

## The Outlook for Italy's Energy Market Amid Regulatory Changes, Geopolitical Tensions, and RES Dynamics

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

-   Market signals remain positive for RES-E, with **captured prices
    projected to stay above the LCOE** through 2040. Despite that,
    regulatory delays and grid infrastructure challenges, if not solved,
    are expected to slow down the expansion of RES-E and BESS, which was
    brilliant in 2023 and 2024, (+ 4.5 GW/year). In the BAU Scenario,
    **RES-E is expected to surpass 50% of the energy mix by 2032**,
    falling short of policy targets.

-   We forecast a **bullish trend in the electricity price for
    2025-2026**: CCGTs cost reductions due to gas price trends are in
    fact compensated by sustained logistic costs and the CO2 price
    increasing trend

-   For CCGTs, flexibility is a key driver to business success:
    **captured CSS is projected to avergare 10 €/MWh** for the next
    years, while baseload CSS remains negative (-2.5 €/MWh on average),
    with **declining load factors** (1500 EOH, on average in the
    Northern zone). The increased penetration of RES will lead to a more
    significant reduction in EOH in the Southern zone, accompanied by
    higher captured prices. Strategic market reforms, like capacity
    remuneration mechanisms, are crucial to mitigate missing money risks
    as ASM volumes narrow.

-   A modest economic recovery and increased electrification are
    **boosting electricity consumption to 312 TWh in 2024**, but
    **demand is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until
    2026**. Thanks to NRRP measures, forecasts are ranging from 327 TWh
    to 358 TWh by 2030. Meanwhile, a contraction in overall electricity
    demand in Europe,coupled with improved hydro generation and nuclear
    availability, contributed to a 15% increase in net imports in 2023,
    reaching 53 TWh. Systematic overgeneration from high RES-E
    production and slow demand recovery is likely to keep imports above
    45 TWh through 2040.

-   Gas prices have risen slightly this summer due to geopolitical
    tensions but are not expected to rise significantly until winter,
    with a **potential bullish cycle anticipated by winter 2025-2026**.
    **Normalization is expected from 2026 onwards** as liquefaction and
    regasification capacity increases, easing LNG market tensions. The
    **average CO2 price for 2024 is projected to remain close to
    €70/ton**. Additional demand from the maritime sector, combined with
    the phasing out of free allowances for the aviation sector and the
    implementation of the CBAM, is expected to support a rise in CO2
    prices towards the €110/ton threshold by 2030.

### Key Insights {.unnumbered}

#### Modest 2024 growth highlights slow recovery towards pre-crisis levels by 2027

*Italian power demand rose by 2.3% in 2024*, reaching 312.2 TWh, closely aligning with our IIIQ24 projections (a variance of just 9 GWh). This marks the *first annual increase since 2018*, excluding the 2021 post-pandemic rebound. However, *growth remains modest*, reflecting *macroeconomic challenges, delayed electrification, and weak industrial performance*. GDP expanded by only 0.8%, and industrial output continued to contract, particularly in energy-intensive sectors.

The 2024 increase in power demand was partly driven by a *rebound in industrial consumption, supported by the normalization of gas prices* as Europe adapts its supply mix to the absence of Russian piped flows. Expected declines in TTF and PSV prices are easing cost pressures on industries, reversing the significant consumption drop in 2023 caused by energy-saving measures during the 2022–2023 gas price surge. However, *persistent industrial stagnation and modest GDP growth projected at +0.9% for 2025 have tempered expectations for electricity demand*. This, combined with *partial decoupling observed between economic growth and electricity consumption*, has prompted a *downward revision of our power demand forecast*: -0.4 GW in 2025, -1.7 GW in 2026, and an average reduction of -4.0 GW annually beyond 2027 in the Reference scenario. Annual *power demand growth is now projected at 1.1% for 2025–2030*, equating to 3 TWh per year—a pace not consistently observed since before 2008. Consumption is expected to exceed pre-crisis levels (320 TWh) by 2027 in the Reference scenario and by 2025 under the High RES case, supported by favorable economic conditions.

*Over the medium to long term (2030–2050), demand growth is anticipated to remain steady*, consistently exceeding 2.5 TWh per year. The *recovery in demand* in this horizon is expected to be *driven by the electrification of final consumption and the development of new electricity use segments*, which will play an increasingly critical role
in shaping future demand dynamics, *rather than a full recovery of industrial production*.

#### PV installations spur RES production but targets attainment is at risk without regulatory progress

2024 marked a *record year for renewable energy production* in Italy, with 101 TWh generated (+16% from 87 TWh in 2023), bringing the *RES share of total production to 49.8%* (based on data through November). This growth was driven by a rebound in hydroelectric generation, which returned to its historical average at 52 TWh (+30% y/y), and by solar production, which reached 28 TWh (+14% y/y).

The surge in RES production in 2024 was primarily driven by a *19% increase in PV output*, while *wind production declined by approximately 7%*. This growth in PV generation can be attributed to both the expansion of installed capacity and higher producibility linked to improved irradiation levels. *Photovoltaic capacity increased by 6 GW*, exceeding the 5 GW added in 2023, while *wind capacity grew by 600 MW*, consistent with the 500 MW installed the previous year. *Lombardy and Lazio led the rankings* for newly installed capacity, aligning with historical trends and both surpassing the “Aree Idonee” target for installations during 2021–2024.

Our *wind installed capacity projections have been slightly revised* from the IIIQ24 release, reflecting limited offshore wind development in the Centre-North region, while adopting a more optimistic outlook for onshore capacity expansion in the Southern and insular areas. Notably, the majority of offshore wind projects submitted to MASE in 2023 and 2024 are concentrated in the Southern and insular regions, with only one project proposed in the Centre-North.

For the medium-to-long term, *we continue to anticipate a deceleration in RES penetration growth during 2025 and 2026*, particularly in PV deployment, with installed capacity expected to increase by less than 2 GW in 2025 and just under 3 GW in 2026. This slowdown is attributed to several factors. Firstly, the scheduling of the *FERX and "FERX Transitorio" auctions* may encourage some developers to *delay construction activities* to ensure eligibility for participation. The FERX Transitorio, designed to ease the transition to the new auctioning framework, remains in its early implementation phase, with developers closely monitoring the finalization of operational guidelines. Secondly, *regulatory uncertainty persists*, driven by delays in *regional deliberations on the "Aree Idonee" Decree* and the complexities introduced by the *Testo Unico sulle Rinnovabili (TUFER)*. The TUFER, published in its final version in the Gazzetta Ufficiale, may pose additional challenges for developers. For an in-depth analysis of its implications, refer to our newsletter publication (link).

Consequently, under the Reference scenario, solar installed capacity is projected to reach only 51 GW and wind capacity 17 GW by 2030, significantly *below the PNIEC targets of 80 GW and 28 GW*, respectively. This shortfall is primarily attributed to *the current permitting pace, which remains insufficient to achieve the 9–10 GW of annual installations* required to meet national objectives. However, regulatory advancements and the effective implementation of current incentive schemes could accelerate RES development, making the 9 GW annual target a more attainable expectation.

Finally, our demand and RES production projections indicate that *RES generation will cover 49% of Italian electricity demand by 2030*, falling significantly short of the PNIEC target of 63%.

#### Italy's storage market is evolving, with 16 GW in projects under evaluation, though regulatory changes could slow deployment

The expected growth of storage in the coming years will be essential in supporting the integration of non-programmable renewable generation, ensuring greater stability and flexibility of the national electricity system. Indeed, storage systems will not only optimise energy management but also help mitigate the cannibalisation effect of renewable power plants, improving the overall efficiency of the system.

To support this integration, the *PNIEC defines a target of achieving an additional capacity of 72 GWh of storage by 2030*, including utility-scale and distributed projects. *Utility-scale development will be concentrated mainly in Southern regions*, where the presence of non-programmable renewable generation is higher, while *distributed capacity will be developed mainly in Northern Italian regions*, often integrated with residential and commercial PV systems.

To respond to the goals, the *storage market in Italy is beginning to evolve* rapidly. An analysis of the authorisation processes submitted to the MASE reveals a *pipeline of about 16 GW of projects with authorisations already obtained or under evaluation*. Investments in storage technology will be mainly supported by *regulated mechanisms*, including the MACSE auctions, planned for mid-2025 and mainly aimed at developing capacity in the regions of the South and Islands, and the Capacity Market, which can help support investments in the areas of the North, where the MACSE quota will be marginal.

Starting in 2025, *Regions will play a central role in managing authorizations* for storage power plants. They will be *responsible for permitting stand-alone storage systems up to 200 MW*, while larger projects will remain under the jurisdiction of MASE. This shift, introduced by the final draft of the TUFER, marks a step toward greater regional autonomy. However, this redistribution of responsibilities *may result in authorization delays*, potentially preventing some projects from being ready to participate in the first MACSE auction.

Our IVQ24 projections adopt a refined approach, considering the *potential for BESS development within incentivizable mechanisms* in the short and medium term and *RES development trajectories* and localization in the long term. Total BESS capacity, including both small- and utility-scale systems, is projected to reach *48 GWh by 2030*, a +41 GWh increase from 2023 levels. Utility-scale capacity is expected to be concentrated in the Southern and insular regions (78% of the total), while small-scale storage will dominate in the Northern regions (60% of the total).

####PUN expected to return to follow a sustained downward trajectory only post-2026 with new liquefaction capacity 

The *annual 2024 PUN average settled at 107.6 €/MWh*, aligning closely with our IIIQ24 projections (107.8 €/MWh) and slightly exceeding our IQ and IIQ expectations (Reference case). While this marks a reduction of approximately 15% compared to the 2023 average of 127 €/MWh, *prices remain elevated relative to pre-crisis levels*.

Despite high levels of RES production achieved over the past year, thermoelectric generation remains the marginal source in the Italian market and is expected to maintain this role in the near term. Consequently, the slight reduction in power prices is primarily attributed to developments in the gas market. *In 2024, gas demand stagnated* due to milder winter temperatures reducing heating needs and a struggling industrial sector yet to recover fully. This *subdued demand facilitated the replenishment of gas storage*, creating an additional buffer against demand fluctuations. Meanwhile, *gas supply remained stable*, with no significant interruptions, allowing prices to edge closer to pre-crisis levels.

However, *gas price volatility remained high*, driven by the termination of Russian gas supply contracts and delays in developing liquefaction capacity. *We anticipate a tight gas market with sustained volatility persisting through 2025 and 2026* as the market awaits new liquefaction capacity from Qatar and the United States. Regarding adaptation to the interruption of Russian gas supplies, *Italy's high network and transportation tariffs—among the highest in Europe—limit its ability to position itself as an exporting country* to Eastern and Central European nations, such as Austria, that were most impacted by the suspension of Russian flows.

Overall, *our PUN projections have been revised downward*, with reductions of approximately -2 €/MWh for 2025, -6 €/MWh for 2026, and over 5 €/MWh for the post-2026 period. This revision is attributed to two primary factors. First, the anticipated decline in power demand throughout the forecast horizon limits the operability of CCGTs, thereby leading to a *reduction in Clean Spark Spread (CSS) expectations for thermoelectric plants*. Second, *adjustments in gas logistic component* for the 2025–2030 period have contributed to the downward revision, including the stabilization of the CRVOS reimbursement mechanism—which thermoelectric plants can claim and will remain unchanged for the next five years—and the elimination of the CRVBL component, previously established to cover gas balancing costs, which has now been set to zero.

In line with IIIQ24 projections, *we anticipate a rebound in the PUN in 2025 to 112 €/MWh*, driven by potential *tensions in the gas market* and CO2 prices remaining around 85 €/ton, reflecting the *full implementation of the ETS reform*. However, with the continued integration of RES capacity, further price normalization post-2026, and sustained levels of electricity imports, we project *prices to fall below 100 €/MWh by 2029* in the Reference scenario and by 2026 in the High RES case.

The reference scenario predicts a 0.4% year-on-year GDP growth in 2024,
with a stronger increase of 1% in 2025, driven by an anticipated easing
of financial conditions. A gradual easing of monetary policies in the
second half of the year, along with positive wage dynamics, should
contribute to growth in 2025. In the worst-case scenario, if
inflationary pressures persist, GDP is projected to decline by 0.1%
year-on-year in 2024 and see a modest increase of 0.3% in 2025.
Conversely, the best-case scenario, characterized by accelerated
disinflation and a recovery in investments, would result in GDP growth
of up to 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.

Federal Reserve have indeed approved the first cuts to reference rates
to support investments, following the reduction in inflation risk. The
path to monetary normalization remains uncertain, though, as the
decisions of the two Central Banks are highly dependent on economic

pressure on prices. Europe's LNG import capacity is poised to expand by
a further 30 Bcm in 2024, enabling additional LNG arrivals, which will

The 2023 logistic cost for Italian gas-fired units averaged 4 €/MWh amid
the increase of the CRVOS (which pays storage injections incentives),
CRVBL (which covers the charges associated with the gas system balancing
activity) and the CVU (which covers variable charges and it’s linked to
the gas price trend) components. The variable logistic cost remains
around 4 €/MWh short-term due to the essential CRVOS component for
storage injection incentives, though thermoelectric producers could
request over 60% exemption from October 2024 (ARERA Resolution
384/2024). The remaining losses stemmed from extra cost derived from
2022 emergency gas purchases to rebuild storages (nearly 5 Bln€) will be
recovered through final customers’ bills over five years. The ARERA
Resolution 263/2024 temporary fixes the CRVBL component (which covers
the charges associated with the gas system balancing activity) equal to
zero from January 2025, as a result of the improved natural gas price
scenario. As a precautionary measure, we assume a gradual return to
historical average levels in the second half of 2025 to account for the
volatility of the current transport cost environment, which reverberates
on prices consequently.

In our Reference scenario, the average CO2 price for 2024 is projected
to remain around 70 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the
ETS reform. The phasing out of free allowances for aviation (50% by
2025) and the removal of 90 million permits in 2024 are expected to put
upward pressure on allowance prices by reducing supply. From 2025
onward, the inclusion of the maritime transport sector will further

recovery, which is expected to be slow due to ongoing economic
challenges.

market still in its early stages of development leads us to assume a
business-as-usual (BAU) trend over the long term, beginning with the
annual level of electric vehicle (EV) additions projected for 2030.

In 2015, the approval of the European guidelines on capacity allocation
and congestion management (CACM) introduced new parameters to be
followed in the zonal configuration review process. In 2018, Terna began
a process to review the zonal configurations in compliance with such
rules.
:::

::: callout-left
#### 21-onwards {.unnumbered}
:::

The current zonal configuration derives from the base case proposed by
Terna in compliance with the CACM. Differences compared to the previous
configuration: (i) elimination of the limited production poles, (ii)
inclusion of a new bidding zone corresponding to the Calabria region,
(iii) displacement of the Umbria region from the Centre-North zone to
the Centre-South market zone.

The zonal distribution of electricity demand is based on historical
regional data published by Terna and subsequent econometric
elaborations. In the Reference case, the zonal distribution of
electricity needs is as follows: North (57%), Central-North (9%),
Central-South (17%), South (7%), Calabria (2%), Sicily (6%), Sardinia
(3%). Slight differences in such figures between the alternative cases

## Net Import

SUSTAINED NET IMPORTS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO THE NORTHERN ZONE.
AS A RESULT, NET IMPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO REACH UP TO 50 TWH BY THE END
OF 2024. AFTER 2029, THE COMPLETION OF A 600 MW POWER INTERCONNECTOR
WITH TUNISIA (MONTEL) WILL BOOST ELECTRICITY EXPORTS**
:::

![](figs/27_Net_Import.png)

::::: callout-item

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Building on the trend observed in 2023 and the first half of 2024, net
imports from neighboring countries are expected to exceed the historical
average. This is primarily driven by the recovery of French nuclear
power production following two years of operation and maintenance
interruptions, increased hydro production in Switzerland, and a general
lag in the recovery of European electricity demand. Net imports are
projected to reach 49.7 TWh in 2024 and are anticipated to remain stable
through 2025, covering almost 16% of electricity demand in the
short-term.
:::

The combination of consistently low demand and continued growth in
renewable energy capacity across Europe is expected to lead to systemic
overgeneration in the medium term, confirming imports a cost-effective
solution. Net imports are projected to remain steady, averaging around
49 TWh annually through 2029. However, with the activation of the Elmed
interconnection between Sicily and Tunisia by the end of 2028, net
import balance will shrink to around 45 TWh as over 3.5 TWh of
electricity is redirected for export.

Import levels are expected to remain stable also after 2030, ranging
above 45 TWh. The slight increase in net import seen from 2035 is due to
an estimated reduction (1 TWh ca.) in the export flows towards Tunisia,
following the implementation of the Tunisian system development plan.

After the phase-out of coal-fired units, residual demand is expected to
rebound. However, existing combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) will face
significant competition from sustained import levels and new
high-efficiency entrants supported by the capacity market. In the low

energy efficiency improvements and increased renewable penetration.
Conversely, in the high scenario, residual demand gradually increases as

dynamics and existing units remain close to 1600 EOH. In the High
scenario, the improvement of switching conditions is hampered by the
high level of imports from abroad, with EOH of existing units over 2000
favored by phase-out after 2035. High-efficiency units stabilize below
the 4800 EOH only in the Low scenario.

:::

::: callout-right
Under BAU market conditions and moderate renewable penetration, the risk
of overgeneration remains limited in both the Reference and High cases.
However, a more pronounced increase in capacity installation in the
South macro-zone could result in higher instances of overgeneration
during certain hours in the Low case scenario.
:::
:::::

::::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The increased penetration of renewable energy sources expected after
2027 is likely to raise the risk of overgeneration, potentially leading
to around 2 TWh of excess electricity in the Low scenario by 2030. The
curtailment effect may become more pronounced under specific local grid
conditions. In contrast, the Reference scenario anticipates a more
moderate level of overgeneration, approaching 0.5 TWh by 2030. Overall,
during this decade, overgeneration is expected to intensify due to the
rapid expansion of renewable energy in the Southern regions of the
country, and it could be exacerbated if coupled with insufficient grid
reinforcement.
:::
:::::

To effectively manage the increasing penetration of renewable energy and
the resulting overgeneration, substantial investments in grid
reinforcement and high-capacity energy storage solutions will be
essential throughout the 2030s. These measures will be critical for
balancing the grid and maintaining a stable energy supply, particularly
in regions more susceptible to overgeneration. Additionally, this excess
energy production presents an opportunity to expand electrolysis
capacity, which would not only harness surplus energy but also support
continued investments in renewable energy sources.

In the long term, the expansion of renewable capacity—particularly in
the Southern regions—is expected to significantly increase the incidence
of systematic overgeneration, especially on the islands. Grid
investments and battery energy storage systems (BESS) will likely prove
inadequate to address this issue, thereby creating favorable conditions
for the adoption of green hydrogen technologies. In the Reference
scenario, installed electrolysis capacity could reach nearly 0.5 GW,
predominantly concentrated in Sardinia. Over time, electrolysis capacity
can effectively mitigate overgeneration by offering a mechanism to store
surplus renewable energy. Moreover, by enhancing demand during periods
of high renewable energy source (RES) production, it can help stabilize
prices and alleviate the cannibalization effect, particularly during the
later stages of the transition.

Despite some observed increases in technology costs over the past year,
the solar energy sector continues to achieve market parity. Baseload
prices are projected to stabilize above 100€/MWh during the 2024-2025
period, driven by rising CO2 costs and escalating logistical expenses.
As a result, solar power plants are expected to capture rates that

Solar power plants stand to benefit from projected moderate increases in
power prices, with captured prices varying between approximately 98€/MWh
and 100€/MWh in the Northern zone, depending on the technology (Tracker
or Fixed Tilt). In the Southern zones, captured prices range between
88€/MWh and 92€/MWh.

The accelerating rate of RES installations, along with the resulting
cannibalization and overgeneration effects — only partially mitigated by
energy storage systems and grid improvements — is influencing zonal
captured prices. These prices are diverging from baseload prices and are
projected to fall below 95 €/MWh by 2030, even in the Northern zones.

The increasing occurrence of overgeneration signals the need for
energy-intensive storage systems, which help partially ease the
cannibalization effect. After 2030, this effect becomes more significant
for solar energy captured prices, particularly in Southern market zones
with higher renewable penetration, pushing long-term prices below 50
€/MWh in the South and below 60 €/MWh in the North.

### Wind Captured Prices

Captured prices continue to align closely with zonal baseload prices in
the long term. The overgeneration resulting from increased solar
production significantly affects the early 2030s; however, the outcomes
for both energy sources remain more influenced by zonal market dynamics
than by changes in price trends. By 2030, captured prices in the
Northern zones stay above 100 €/MWh, while those in the Southern zones
approach 95 €/MWh. Additionally, both sources benefit from a production
profile that is more evenly distributed throughout the day and across
the year.

### Investment costs and IRR of Solar and Wind

::: callout-main
**INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE PV MODULES MARKET DRIVES DOWN INVESTMENT
COSTS FOR SOLAR IN THE MID AND LONG TERM, EVEN THOUGH GRID CONNECTION
AND LAND COSTS MAY RISE. HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR WIND**
:::

![](figs/59_Capex_Wind.png)

::::: callout-item

#### Solar {.unnumbered}

::: callout-right
The high competition in the PV modules market, predominantly led by
Chinese manufacturers, has driven the costs of PV modules down to around
€150,000 per MW. Nearly 30% of the total cost for a module is attributed
to polysilicon, a relatively inexpensive but highly volatile material.
Other critical materials with high demand and low availability, such as
silver, could potentially increase the price of the technology in the
future. Generally, due to market competitiveness, PV modules account for
only 15% of the total solar CAPEX. Two significant costs impact the
total CAPEX for solar technologies. The cost of connecting to the grid,
which varies greatly by project, is expected to rise in the coming
years. This is due to the increasing number of projects in remote
locations, complicating high-voltage grid connections. Additionally, the
cost of land acquisition or rental, which constitutes nearly 8% of the
total cost, has increased in recent years. The anticipated acceleration
of new installations in the coming years may further drive up land
demand for solar projects, as available sites diminish, thereby
increasing rental costs. This cost structure typically results in an IRR
of around 7% (base case considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices,
30 years time horizon) for solar projects, with regional variations
according to different zonal captured prices. For agri-voltaic projects,
a markup of 20%-40% on the total investment cost must be applied,
leading to a lower expected IRR of around 6%.

#### Wind {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The primary cost for a wind plant is the turbine and inverter, which
account for 60% of the total cost. Grid connection represents 10% of the
wind CAPEX, which is approximately €1.5 million for an onshore wind
project. In the short and mid-term, technology costs are unlikely to
decrease due to the low rate of new installations, which limits the
potential for economies of scale. However, as the technology matures,
particularly in Northern countries where installation rates are higher,
there may be a reduction in technology costs. Despite this, the CAPEX
for a wind project is expected to remain above €1 million until 2040.
This cost structure typically results in an IRR of around 7% (base case
considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices, 20 years time horizon)
for onshore wind projects.

however, the performance of both sources remains more closely tied to
zonal market dynamics than to changes in price structure. Additionally,
both sources benefit from a production profile that is more evenly

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to partially
recover from 2022 but will remain below historical levels due to: (i)
increased availability of thermoelectric reserves from reversed
switching conditions, (ii) changes in network management practices by
Terna since the 2022 cost-containment scheme, and (iii) feasibility
intervals imposed on power plants under the new Intra-Day Market

The exit of coal-fired units on the mainland and the progressive
increase in the energy mix of renewable production are compensated by
the entry of (i) new thermoelectric and energy intensive storage
capacity sustained by the CM mechanism, and (ii) the diffusion of power
intensive BESS that are going to reduce the need of ex ante scheduling,
given the availability of flexible resources in the system.

ASM ex-ante volumes are expected to contract and then remain stable
during the 2030s as consequence of a more efficient purchase, thanks to
flexible resources and grid reinforcement. On the other side an increase
of MB can be expected in line with the increasing volatility driven by
the strong development of RES in the scenario, sustaining units
operativity.

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are projected to remain low
compared to recent levels in the alternative scenarios as well, with
variations arising from the differing degrees of competition in the
thermoelectric sector within the Day-Ahead Market. This competition
results in varying levels of running reserves.

In the Low scenario, the swift expansion of non-programmable renewable
generation is mitigated by advancements in grid infrastructure and the
accelerated deployment of energy-intensive storage solutions. In
contrast, the High scenario sees the proliferation of less flexible
resources, thereby increasing the demand for additional volumes in the
Market for Secondary Reserves.
:::

In the Low scenario, continued grid development and significant growth
in energy-intensive storage assets contribute to limiting ASM volumes.
In contrast, in the High scenario, ASM volumes remain stable due to a
greater presence of CCGT in the Day-Ahead Market and the continued
operation of coal plants until 2025. Additionally, the development of
energy-intensive storage facilitates better regulation of the system.

**GRID BOTTLENECK RESOLUTION AND THE PENETRATION OF BESS ARE KEY DRIVERS

In the initial years of the Capacity Market's delivery, the strike price
is anticipated to exert a cap on prices for start-up and upward
regulation, particularly in the Centre-South market zone. However, the
recent decline in ASM volumes may promote increased price competition
across Italy compared to previous years.

Price competition in the ancillary services market is expected to
increase gradually as innovative technological solutions, such as
electrochemical storage, become available at more competitive prices.
Assuming the extension of the capacity remuneration mechanism, the
strike price, along with the Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) of
batteries, could emerge as key factors shaping ancillary services prices
in the future.

Price projections are derived from a statistical approach that analyzes
the historical bidding strategies of market participants in the
ancillary services market. It is assumed that the historical
distributions of price spreads between Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and
ancillary services prices for each type of service will remain constant
in the future. In comparison to the previous release, the updated
short-term price projections for ancillary services now reflect the
impacts of revised assumptions regarding DAM dynamics and prices.

# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2025–2050 (with projections up to 2060) are developed by MBS Consulting experts using proprietary tools and market expertise. These scenarios are based on econometric and structural models, combined with expert insights, detailed regulatory knowledge, and rigorous monitoring of market dynamics.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider various geopolitical and economic hypotheses stemming from regulatory, financial, and fundamental adjustments to disruptions caused by both the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. These factors are viewed as key determinants of the future equilibrium in energy markets.

The current scenario update incorporates climate variable trends that align with historical averages.

In this context, we have defined three scenarios:

-   The **Low RES scenario**: Characterized by persistently high fuel and power prices amid negative or stagnant economic growth, this scenario hampers investments and slows the energy transition process.

-   In the **Reference scenario**: Marked by progress in the energy transition process, this scenario reflects a diversification of energy sources supported by existing policies. Combined with efficiency improvements, it maintains the energy market on a transformational path. Economic growth is expected to recover gradually over the next two years.

-   The **High RES scenario**: This scenario assumes favorable weather conditions and a rapid energy transition, facilitated by low inflation and a faster economic recovery. These factors would reduce demand for power and fossil fuels over the next few years, limiting upward pressure on energy prices and potentially driving a downward acceleration.

## The demand puzzle: slow recovery in a renewable-driven market

***While the focus on renewable energy expansion remains central, the market must also address the challenge of subdued demand. Our projections for demand growth have in fact been adjusted downward to account for the modest recovery observed post-crisis and a partial decoupling from GDP trends; pre-crisis levels are now expected to be reached only after 2027. In the long-term, modest demand growth is primarily driven by electrification. The foreseen declines in gas prices post-2026, as supply tensions ease, are expected to exert downward pressure on power prices. Concurrently, CCGT operability is increasingly constrained by low demand and rising RES production, exacerbating negative Clean Spark Spreads (CSS) and thus further weighing on the electricity price trajectory beyond 2030. Although progress in RES installations remains promising, weak demand poses a significant challenge to renewable investments, potentially jeopardizing national installation targets.***

**Italian power demand rose by 2.3% in 2024**, reaching 312.2 TWh, which closely aligns with our IIIQ24 projections (a variance of just 90 GWh). This marks the **first annual increase since 2018**, excluding the 2021 post-pandemic rebound. **Limited demand growth** reflects **macroeconomic challenges, delayed electrification, and weak industrial performance**, with GDP having expanded by only 0.8%, and industrial output having continued to contract, particularly in energy-intensive sectors.

Persistent industrial stagnation and modest GDP growth, projected at +0.9% for 2025, combined with the observed persistence of a **partial decoupling between economic growth and electricity consumption**, led to a **downward revision of our power demand forecast**: -0.4 TWh in 2025, -1.7 TWh in 2026, and an average reduction of -4.0 TWh annually beyond 2027 in the Reference scenario. Annual **power demand growth is now projected at 1.1% for 2025–2030 (3 TWh per year)**, a modest but still notable acceleration, not seen consistently since before 2008. Consumption is expected to exceed pre-crisis levels (320 TWh) by 2027 in the Reference scenario.
**Over the medium to long term (2030–2050), demand growth is anticipated to remain steady**, exceeding 2.5 TWh per year, **driven by the electrification of final consumption and the development of new electricity use segments**, which will play an increasingly critical role in shaping future demand dynamics.
The surge in PV installations spurs RES production but targets attainment is at risk without regulatory progress
2024 marked a **record year for renewable energy production** in Italy, with **129 TWh generated** (+13% from 113 TWh in 2023), bringing the RES share of total production to 42.5%, thanks to a **rebound in hydroelectric generation**, which returned to its historical average at 52 TWh (+30% y/y), and an **increase in solar production**, which reached 36 TWh (+19% y/y). The 2024 surge in RES production was driven by a **19% increase in PV output**, having offset a 6% decline in wind generation. PV production growth resulted from a 7 GW capacity expansion—exceeding 2023’s 5 GW—and improved irradiation levels, while wind capacity grew by 600 MW, consistent with the prior year.
Our **wind installed capacity projections were slightly adjusted on a regional basis** to better align the onshore and offshore development mix with recent trends. These revisions reflect limited offshore wind development in the Centre-North zone and sustained onshore capacity growth in the Southern and insular areas. Notably, most offshore wind projects submitted to MASE in 2023 and 2024 are concentrated in the Southern and insular regions, with only one project proposed for the Centre-North.
We still expect a deceleration in RES penetration growth during 2025 and 2026**, particularly in PV deployment, with installed capacity increasing by less than 2 GW in 2025 and just under 3 GW in 2026. This slowdown is attributed to several factors. Firstly, the awaited scheduling of the FERX and "FERX Transitorio" auctions may encourage some developers to delay construction activities to ensure eligibility for auction participation. Despite the introduction of the FERX Transitorio, designed to ease the implementation of the new auctioning framework, developers are still monitoring the finalization of BANDI operational guidelines. Secondly, **regulatory uncertainty persists**, driven by delays in **regional deliberations on the "Aree Idonee" Decree** and the complexities introduced by the **Testo Unico sulle Rinnovabili (TUFER)**. The TUFER, published in its final version in the Gazzetta Ufficiale, may pose additional challenges for developers. For an in-depth analysis of its implications, refer to our newsletter publication [link](https://mbsconsulting.ref-e.com/newsletter/16768/il-tufer-semplificazione-ben-riuscita/page/).

Under the Reference scenario, solar installed capacity is projected to reach only 51 GW and wind capacity 17 GW by 2030, significantly **below the PNIEC targets of 80 GW and 28 GW**, respectively. This shortfall is primarily attributed to **the current permitting pace, which remains insufficient to achieve the 9–10 GW of annual installations** required to meet national objectives. Our demand and RES production projections indicate that **RES generation will cover 49% of Italian electricity demand by 2030**, falling significantly short of the PNIEC target of 63  %.

Italy's storage market is progressing, with 16 GW in projects under evaluation, though regulatory changes could slow deployment
The expected growth of storage in the coming years will be essential in supporting the integration of non-programmable renewable generation, ensuring greater stability and flexibility of the national electricity system. Indeed, storage systems will not only optimize energy management but also help mitigate the cannibalization effect of renewable power plants, improving the overall efficiency of the system.
The **PNIEC targets 72 GWh of additional storage capacity by 2030**, encompassing utility-scale, distributed projects, and their geographical distribution**utility-scale development should contribute significantly in Southern regions**, where non-programmable renewable generation is most prevalent, while **distributed capacity is aimed to grow primarily in Northern regions**, often integrated with residential and commercial PV systems.
The storage market in Italy currently factors in a **pipeline of approximately 16 GW of projects**, either authorized or under evaluation, whose realization will depend significantly on the support of regulated mechanisms. These include the MACSE auctions, scheduled for mid-2025, which primarily aim to develop capacity in the South and Islands, and the Capacity Market, which is expected to drive investments in the North, where the MACSE allocation will be limited.

Starting in 2025, while larger projects remain under MASE’s jurisdiction, **Regions will manage authorizations for storage plants up to 200 MW**, which could lead to bottlenecks in the processing of requests and delay projects eligible for the first MACSE auction,. 
Our IVQ24 projections employ a refined methodology, now accounting for the **potential for BESS development within incentivized mechanisms** in the short and medium term, as well as RES deployment trajectories and localization over the long term. We consequently revised expectations higher for utility-scale storage in Southern and insular regions, now comprising 78% of the total as of 2030. Small-scale storage will lead in the Northern regions instead, accounting for 60% of the total. Total BESS capacity, encompassing both small- and utility-scale systems, is projected to reach **48 GWh by 2030**, a net increase of +41 GWh from 2023 levels. 

PUN expected to decline towards 100 €/MWh only post-2026 with new liquefaction capacity improving the global LNG market supply-demand balance.
We confirm our expectations for a **slight increase in the PUN in 2025 to 112 €/MWh**, driven by a still **tight gas market** and CO2 prices remaining around 85 €/ton, reflecting the **full implementation of the ETS reform**. However, with the continued integration of RES capacity, further price normalization post-2026, and sustained levels of electricity imports, we project **prices to fall below 100 €/MWh by 2029** in the Reference scenario and by 2026 in the High RES case.

The **annual 2024 PUN average settled at 107.6 €/MWh**, aligning closely with our IIIQ24 projections (107.8 €/MWh) While this marks a reduction of approximately 15% compared to the 2023 average of 127 €/MWh, **prices remain elevated relative to pre-crisis levels**.
Despite the high level of RES production achieved over the past year, thermoelectric generation remains the marginal source in the Italian market and is expected to maintain this role in the near term. Consequently, the short-term dynamics of power prices are still primarily driven by developments in the gas market. **In 2024, gas demand stagnated** due to milder winter temperatures having reduced heating needs and a struggling industrial sector. The replenishment of gas storage was consequently facilitated, creating an additional buffer against demand fluctuations. This combined with stable gas supples, allowing prices to edge closer to pre-crisis levels.

In the short term, **the global LNG market balance remains fragile** though, since supply growth is limited and the absence of Russian pipeline gas continues to support the European demand. Norway and Algeria emerged as key suppliers, but **Italy's high network and transportation tariffs—among the highest in Europe—limit its ability to position itself as an exporting country** to Eastern and Central European nations, such as Austria, that were most impacted by the suspension of Russian flows. Prices, currently exceeding €30/MWh, are therefore unlikely to decline significantly before 2026, when the market awaits new liquefaction capacity from Qatar and the United States to ease the global LNG market tightness.
However, **adjustments in gas logistic component** for the 2025–2030 period, including the stabilization of the CRVOS reimbursement mechanism and the elimination of the CRVBL component, led to a downward revision of the gas price projections. Consequently, **our PUN projections have also been revised downward**, with reductions of approximately 2 €/MWh for 2025, 6 €/MWh for 2026, and over 5 €/MWh for the post-2026 period. The anticipated decline in power demand throughout the forecast horizon limits the operability of CCGTs, thereby leading to a **reduction in Clean Spark Spread (CSS) expectations for thermoelectric plants**.

The reduction in financing rates initiated in 2024, alongside positive
trends in wages and labor market conditions, is expected to support
slightly stronger GDP growth of 0.9% in 2025. These dynamics are
anticipated to drive a recovery in investment and consumption,
contributing to higher growth of 1.1% in 2026. In a worst-case scenario,
growth would remain subdued at 0.4% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, with
persistent inflationary pressures keeping investment and consumption
constrained. Conversely, if inflation remains under control and
investment outpaces expectations, GDP growth could reach 1.2% in 2025
and 1.6% in 2026.

### LNG

::: callout-main
**THE HALT OF RUSSIAN PIPELINE GAS FLOWS BOOSTS EUROPEAN LNG DEMAND,
WHILE SUPPLY GROWTH REMAINS LIMITED WORLDWIDE. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS,
THE GLOBAL LNG MARKET BALANCE REMAINS FRAGILE AS A RESULT. THE TIMELY
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LIQUEFACTION FACILITIES IS KEY TO ACHIEVING LOWER
PRICES IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM**

#### 25-26 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Global LNG demand is expected to grow nearly 5% in 2025 and 2026, led by Europe as 30 Bcm of regasification capacity (mostly in Germany) replaces Russian piped gas. Meanwhile, China's LNG demand growth is set to slow due to increased piped gas from Russia via the Power of Siberia pipeline (40 Bcm/y). In South and Southeast Asia, LNG will remain vital for supporting rapid economic growth. However, short-term global supply growth is constrained by construction delays, particularly in the US, tightening the market and potentially driving up winter prices.

Global LNG demand is projected to reach 660 Bcm by 2027, then stabilize below 5% annual growth due to increased renewables in power generation and improved energy efficiency. With new liquefaction capacity from the US and Qatar coming online as scheduled, market tightness should ease, leading to a gradual normalization of LNG prices.

::: callout-main
**A FULL RECOVERY TO PRE-CRISIS GAS DEMAND LEVELS IN EUROPE IS UNLIKELY
IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVES AND RENEWABLE
POWER GENERATION CONTINUES TO ADVANCE. OVER THE LONG TERM, WE EXPECT
DEMAND DECLINES TO ACCELERATE DUE TO EUROPE’S DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS,

#### 25-26 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference scenario, the TTF yearly average for 2025 and 2026 is
projected to remain elevated, above 30 €/MWh, due to a fragile market
balance and potential pressure from geopolitical tensions. Storage
dynamics will play a crucial role, as a faster withdrawal compared to
the previous two years could lead to higher prices during the 2025
summer season, coinciding with the refilling season.

From 2027 onwards, further normalization is expected due to the
significant deployment of new liquefaction capacity. Assuming
progressive growth in global LNG supplies and an acceleration of the
energy transition, European gas prices are projected to steadily decline
towards 30 €/MWh by 2028.

The European decarbonization process will continue to reduce gas demand,
gradually pressuring prices back towards the long-term equilibrium of 25
€/MWh. In the Low Res scenario, geopolitical tensions could leave
commodity shortages unresolved, keeping prices just below 45 €/MWh in
the long term. In contrast, effective green policies, supported by
economic growth, could push prices significantly lower in the High Res
scenario, with the TTF averaging near 10 €/MWh in the long term.

### Spread TTF-PSV

::: callout-main
**AS PIPED FLOWS FROM NORWAY REMAIN CRUCIAL FOR ADEQUATE DEMAND COVERAGE, THE PSV GAS PRICE IS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN A PREMIUM OVER THE TTF IN THE SHORT-TO-MEDIUM TERM. IN THE LONG TERM, THE REBALANCING OF FLOWS IS ANTICIPATED TO LEAD TO A GRADUAL NARROWING OF THE SPREAD TOWARDS ZERO**

The ARERA Resolution 599/2024 confirms all downstream PSV variable
components for Q1-25, as anticipated. The only exception is the RET
component, which covers costs related to White Certificates and
efficiency measures, along with a refund mechanism for thermoelectric
producers, covering nearly 40% of costs. The RET component will increase from 1.1 €/MWh to 2.6 €/MWh starting in July 2025, due to uncertainties and delays in the 2025 regulatory framework for White Certificates definition. The same Resolution confirms that thermoelectric producers can request an exemption of over 60% of the CRVOS component (which covers storage injection incentives) for Q1-25. The remaining losses, stemming from extra costs incurred from 2022 emergency gas purchases (nearly 5 billion euros), will be recovered through final customers' bills over five years. The CRVBL component (covering charges related to gas system balancing activities) will be zero starting January 2025, thanks to the improved natural gas price scenario. As a precautionary measure, we assume a gradual return to historical average levels in the second half of 2025 to account for the volatility of the current transport cost environment, which impacts prices.

::: callout-right
In our Reference scenario, the average CO2 price for 2025 is projected
to spike above 85 €/ton, driven by the ETS reform kick-off. The phasing
out of free allowances for aviation (50% by 2025) and the removal of 90
million permits in 2024 are expected to put upward pressure on allowance
prices by reducing supply. The inclusion of the maritime transport
sector will further increase demand. However, concerns linger about the
pace of demand recovery, which is expected to be slow due to ongoing
economic challenges.

The supply-demand gap is expected to widen starting in 2026 as the
maritime sector joins the ETS and the phasing out of free aviation
allowances is fully implemented. By 2030, the Market Stability Reserve's
reinforcement and an increase in the Linear Reduction Factor to 4.4%

## Net Import

::: callout-main
**THE RECOVERY OF NUCLEAR CAPACITY FROM O&M OPERATIONS INITIATED IN 2022
(ALONG WITH THE CONNECTION OF THE FLAMANVILLE REACTOR AFTER LONG
DELAYS), INCREASED HYDROPOWER PRODUCTION IN SWITZERLAND, AND LOWER
ELECTRICITY DEMAND ACROSS EUROPE, IS EXPECTED TO SUSTAIN NET IMPORTS
INTO THE NORTHERN ZONE. NET IMPORTS ARE PROJECTED TO REACH 50 TWH BY THE
END OF 2024. AFTER 2029, THE COMPLETION OF A 600 MW INTERCONNECTOR WITH
TUNISIA (MONTEL) WILL ENHANCE EXPORT CAPABILITIES.**

:::

::: callout-right
Building on the trends observed in 2023 and 2024, net imports from
neighboring countries are expected to remain above the historical
average in the short term. This sustained level is primarily attributed
to the ongoing recovery of French nuclear power production following two
years of operation and maintenance disruptions, enhanced hydroelectric
output in Switzerland, and a slower-than-anticipated rebound in European
electricity demand. Net imports are projected to reach 49.4 TWh in 2025,
with a slight reduction to 48.9 TWh in 2026, accounting for nearly 16%
of short-term electricity demand.
:::
:::::

::::: callout-item

#### 27-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The persistent combination of subdued electricity demand and ongoing
expansion of renewable energy capacity across Europe is anticipated to
result in systemic overgeneration in the medium term, reinforcing
imports as a cost-efficient option for Italy. This is further supported
by the projection that the PUN will remain at a premium compared to
other European prices over the same horizon. Net imports are expected to
stabilize at an average of approximately 49 TWh annually through 2029.
However, with the commissioning of the Elmed interconnection linking
Sicily and Tunisia by late 2028, the net import balance is projected to
decrease to around 45 TWh, as over 3.5 TWh of electricity is redirected
for export.
:::

::::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Import levels are expected to remain stable also after 2030, ranging
above 45 TWh. The slight increase in net import seen from 2035 is due to
an estimated reduction (1 TWh ca.) in the export flows towards Tunisia,
following the implementation of the Tunisian system development plan.

exhibiting significant zonal variations. In the Northern zone, the load
factor for CCGTs is around 1800 EOH, while the Southern zones show lower

After the phase-out of coal-fired units, residual demand is expected to
rebound. However, existing combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) will face
significant competition from sustained import levels and new
high-efficiency entrants supported by the capacity market. In the low
scenario, residual demand is further reduced due to the effects of
energy efficiency improvements and increased renewable penetration.
Conversely, in the high scenario, residual demand gradually increases as
switching conditions improve.

Existing CCGTs (53%-efficiency) stabilize around 2000 EOH. In the Low
scenario, the great renewable penetration influences competitive
dynamics and existing units remain close to 1600 EOH. In the High
scenario, the improvement of switching conditions is hampered by the
high level of imports from abroad, with EOH of existing units over 2000
favored by phase-out after 2035. High-efficiency units stabilize below
the 4800 EOH only in the Low scenario.

::::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 25-26 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Under BAU market conditions and moderate renewable penetration, the risk
of overgeneration remains low in both the Reference and Low RES
scenarios. However, a more significant increase in capacity installation
in the South macro-zone could lead to more frequent overgeneration
during specific hours in the High RES scenario.
:::
:::::

::::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 27-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The anticipated increase in renewable energy penetration after 2027 is
expected to heighten the risk of overgeneration, potentially resulting
in approximately 3 TWh of excess electricity by 2030 in the High RES
scenario. This curtailment effect could be further amplified by specific
local grid constraints. In comparison, the Reference scenario projects a
more moderate level of overgeneration, reaching around 0.7 TWh by 2030.
Overall, overgeneration is set to escalate throughout the decade, driven
by the rapid expansion of renewables in the Southern regions, and could
be exacerbated by delays or inadequacies in grid reinforcement.
:::
:::::

To effectively manage the increasing penetration of renewable energy and
the resulting overgeneration, substantial investments in grid
reinforcement and high-capacity energy storage solutions will be
essential throughout the 2030s. These measures will be critical for
balancing the grid and maintaining a stable energy supply, particularly
in regions more susceptible to overgeneration. Additionally, this excess
energy production presents an opportunity to expand electrolysis
capacity, which would not only harness surplus energy but also support
continued investments in renewable energy sources.

In the long term, the expansion of renewable capacity---particularly in
the Southern regions---is expected to significantly increase the
incidence of systematic overgeneration, especially on the islands. Grid
investments and battery energy storage systems (BESS) will likely prove
inadequate to address this issue, thereby creating favorable conditions
for the adoption of green hydrogen technologies. In the Reference
scenario, installed electrolysis capacity could reach nearly 0.5 GW,
predominantly concentrated in Sardinia. Over time, electrolysis capacity
can effectively mitigate overgeneration by offering a mechanism to store
surplus renewable energy. Moreover, by enhancing demand during periods
of high RES production, it can help stabilize prices and alleviate the
cannibalization effect, particularly during the later stages of the
transition.

Despite potential challenges in securing land and rising land costs,
technology costs for solar projects have decreased over the past year.
This reduction has been primarily driven by declining panel costs,
supported by increased competition among sellers. These trends are
supporting the market parity for solar technologies, with baseload
prices projected to stabilize between 80 and 100€/MWh during the
2025-2026 period. As a result, solar power plants are expected to
capture rates that exceed the estimated levelized cost of electricity

Market parity continues to be guaranteed for wind plants despite the
investement intensity of those projects, benefitting of their wider
generation profile capable of capturing higher prices than solar plants.
This is largely due to their broader generation profile, which allows
wind projects to capture higher prices compared to solar plants. With
annual captured prices aligning closely with baseload prices, wind power
plants are expected to cover LCOE levels ranging between 85 and 90
€/MWh, in all the zones.

Intra-day price spreads on the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) may reveal
opportunities for pumped hydro units; however, the Ancillary Services
Market, particularly during the real-time balancing phase, is
anticipated to remain their primary source of revenue. Pumped hydro
production is projected to hover around 2.5 TWh.

Under an accelerated RES development path compared to the BAU
trajectory, pumped hydro production could reach 3.9 TWh by 2030 in the
High RES scenario, driven by new opportunities emerging in the DAM as
RES penetration increases. In contrast, the Low RES scenario limits
pumped hydro production to around 2 TWh.

The anticipated growth of storage capacity will be crucial for integrating non-programmable renewables and improving the stability and flexibility of Italy's electricity system. The PNIEC targets 72 GWh of additional storage by 2030, spanning utility-scale and distributed projects, with a focus on Southern regions where renewable generation is concentrated. Italy's storage market has a robust pipeline of projects, but their realization depends heavily on regulated support mechanisms, including the MACSE auction planned for mid-2025, aimed at expanding capacity in the South and islands. By 2030, total BESS capacity is projected to reach 48–65 GWh, combining small-scale and utility-scale systems.

The spread between the PUN and the Southern market zones is expected to

In both the Reference and High RES cases, the incorporation of renewable

The high competition in the PV modules market, predominantly led by
Chinese manufacturers, has driven the costs of PV modules down to around
€150,000 per MW. Nearly 30% of the total cost for a module is attributed
to polysilicon, a relatively inexpensive but highly volatile material.
Other critical materials with high demand and low availability, such as
silver, could potentially increase the price of the technology in the
future. Generally, due to market competitiveness, PV modules account for
only 15% of the total solar CAPEX. Two significant costs impact the
total CAPEX for solar technologies. The cost of connecting to the grid,
which varies greatly by project, is expected to rise in the coming
years. This is due to the increasing number of projects in remote
locations, complicating high-voltage grid connections. Additionally, the
cost of land acquisition or rental, which constitutes nearly 8% of the
total cost, has increased in recent years. The anticipated acceleration
of new installations in the coming years may further drive up land
demand for solar projects, as available sites diminish, thereby
increasing rental costs. This cost structure typically results in an IRR
of around 7% (base case considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices,
30 years time horizon) for solar projects, with regional variations
according to different zonal captured prices. For agri-voltaic projects,
a markup of 20%-40% on the total investment cost must be applied,
leading to a lower expected IRR of around 6%.

The primary cost for a wind plant is the turbine and inverter, which
account for 60% of the total cost. Grid connection represents 10% of the
wind CAPEX, which is approximately €1.5 million for an onshore wind
project. In the short and mid-term, technology costs are unlikely to
decrease due to the low rate of new installations, which limits the
potential for economies of scale. However, as the technology matures,
particularly in Northern countries where installation rates are higher,
there may be a reduction in technology costs. Despite this, the CAPEX
for a wind project is expected to remain above €1 million until 2040.
This cost structure typically results in an IRR of around 7% (base case
considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices, 20 years time horizon)
for onshore wind projects.

### Hydro Run-of-River Captured Prices

Captured prices are expected to remain closely aligned with zonal
baseload prices in the long term. The overgeneration resulting from
increased solar production significantly influences the early 2030s;
however, the performance of both sources remains more closely tied to
zonal market dynamics than to changes in price structure. Additionally,
both sources benefit from a production profile that is more evenly
distributed throughout the day and across the year.

# Ancilliary Services & Fuels Mix

## Ancilliary Services Volumes, Reference Scenario

::: callout-main
**THE DEMAND FOR ANCILLARY SERVICES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW RECENT
LEVELS DUE TO CHANGES IN SYSTEM MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED BY THE
TSO AND INVESTMENTS IN GRID INFRASTRUCTURE AT CRITICAL NODES. HOWEVER,
IN THE LONG TERM, THE EXPANSION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CAPACITY IS LIKELY
TO DRIVE AN INCREASED NEED FOR SYSTEM SERVICES**

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to partially
recover from 2022 but will remain below historical levels due to: (i)
availability of thermoelectric reserves, (ii) changes in network
management practices by Terna since the 2022 cost-containment scheme,
and (iii) feasibility intervals imposed on power plants under the new
Intra-Day Market structure.

The exit of coal-fired units on the mainland and the progressive
increase in the energy mix of renewable production are compensated by
the entry of (i) new thermoelectric and energy intensive storage
capacity sustained by the CM mechanism, and (ii) the diffusion of power
intensive BESS that are going to reduce the need of ex ante scheduling,
given the availability of flexible resources in the system.

The increasing share of renewables in the energy mix will be balanced by
(i) the addition of new thermoelectric capacity and storage systems
supported by the Capacity Market mechanism and MACSE. This is expected
to reduce the need for ex-ante scheduling, thanks to the greater
availability of flexible resources within the system.

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are projected to remain low
compared to recent levels in the alternative scenarios as well, with
variations arising from the differing degrees of competition in the
thermoelectric sector within the Day-Ahead Market. This competition
results in varying levels of running reserves.

In the High RES scenario, the swift expansion of non-programmable
renewable generation is mitigated by advancements in grid infrastructure
and the accelerated deployment of energy-intensive storage solutions. In
contrast, the Low RES scenario sees the proliferation of less flexible
resources, thereby increasing the demand for additional volumes in the
Market for Secondary Reserves.

In the High RES scenario, continued grid development and significant
growth in energy-intensive storage assets contribute to limiting ASM
volumes. In contrast, in the Low RES scenario, ASM volumes remain stable
due to a greater presence of CCGT in the Day-Ahead Market and the
continued operation of coal plants until 2035. Additionally, the
development of energy-intensive storage facilitates better regulation of
the system.

In the delivery years of the Capacity Market's, the strike price is
anticipated to exert a cap on prices for start-up and upward regulation,
particularly in the Centre-South market zone. However, the decline in
ASM volumes may promote increased price competition across Italy
compared to previous years.

Price competition in the ancillary services market is expected to
increase gradually as innovative technological solutions, such as
electrochemical storage, become available at more competitive prices.
Assuming the extension of the capacity remuneration mechanism, the
strike price, along with the Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) of
batteries, could emerge as key factors shaping ancillary services prices
in the future.

Price projections are derived from a statistical approach that analyzes
the historical bidding strategies of market participants in the
ancillary services market. It is assumed that the historical
distributions of price spreads between Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and
ancillary services prices for each type of service will remain constant
in the future. In comparison to the previous release, the updated
short-term price projections for ancillary services now reflect the
impacts of revised assumptions regarding DAM dynamics and prices.
